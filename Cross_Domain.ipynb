The police oversight body said 52 officers were on trial in connection with such killings countrywide. The coastal region has suffered several terror attacks in recent years. The Somali Islamist militant al-Shabab group has been targeting Kenya over the deployment of Kenyan forces to Somalia. Most of the victims were youths including returnees from Somalia who had surrendered after the government promised them amnesty, Haki Africa's report said. Others were allegedly killed as a result of excessive use of force during police crackdowns on protests and other religious groups that had been accused of radicalising young people. Saada Suleiman, who attended the report's launch in the capital, Nairobi, said her husband had been missing for two years since his arrest in a raid on Masjid Musa mosque in Mombasa known for its radical sermons. Haki Africa Executive Director Hussein Khalid said some of those killed were terror suspects, including several radical Muslim clerics, but this was no excuse for the state to execute them without due process. The BBC's Abdinoor Aden in the capital, Nairobi, says officers from the anti-terror unit have been heavily implicated in the report. Murshid Nassir, who heads the National Police Service Commission which vets officers, told the BBC that so-called \"death squads\" did not exist within the force and extrajudicial killings were not condoned. While the chairman of the Independent Policing Oversight Authority promised to take action against officers found guilty of engaging in the killings. Macharia Njeru said 52 officers had been charged and more than 300 officers were being probed for gross human rights violations.\n",

But what about the French, with their centuries of scholarship and ancient institutions? There was a university in Paris before Oxford or Cambridge. French universities are conspicuous by their absence. In the most recent QS World University Rankings there were none in the top 20 and only two in the top 100. That could all change from next year. As part of a huge government-driven academic and economic project, there will be a new university called Paris-Saclay, with a campus south of the French capital. The project has initial funding of 7.5bn euros (£5.9bn) for an endowment, buildings and transport links. The French government is bringing together 19 institutions into a single structure, with the aim of building a university big enough to compete with global giants like Harvard or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Dominique Vernay, the president of this new university, says that within a decade he wants Paris-Saclay to be among the top ranking world universities. \"My goal is to be a top 10 institution,\" he says. In Europe, he wants Paris-Saclay to be in the \"top two or three\". In university rankings, big is beautiful, and the Paris-Saclay will have 70,000 students and 10,000 researchers. There will be an emphasis on graduate courses and recruiting more international students and staff. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch The idea of bringing together individual colleges into a \"federal university\" has been borrowed from the UK. \"Our model isn't that far from the Oxbridge model,\" he says. To put it into scale, Mr Vernay says Paris-Saclay is going to be twice the size of the University of California, Berkeley, one of the flagships of the US university system. Without any extra investment, he says that the existing component parts of the university will put Paris-Saclay straight into the top 20 of the Shanghai global university rankings. It will inherit staff with Nobel Prizes and some very well-established founding partners, including the Ecole Polytechnique, the HEC Paris business school and the National Centre for Scientific\n",

            "Input: summarize: Mr Schleicher, who runs the tests, says the high results of deprived pupils in some Asian countries shows what poor pupils in the UK could achieve. The most disadvantaged pupils in Shanghai match the maths test results of wealthy pupils in the UK. Mr Schleicher says it \"debunks the myth that poverty is destiny\". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove said individual schools in England should take Pisa tests, so that they could compare themselves against international standards. The latest Pisa - Programme for International Student Assessment - test results were published last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranking developed countries in terms of how well 15-year-olds performed in tests in reading, maths and science. Source: OECD This showed the UK as a middle-ranking country, with Asian school systems, such as in Singapore, South Korea and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, as the highest performers. But Mr Schleicher's latest analysis compares the performance of the most deprived 10% of pupils. This reveals how the poorest in many countries overlap with the results of the wealthy in other countries. The poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers taking the test in the UK and the United States. In Europe, the Netherlands has the highest-performing pupils from the poorest families. Poor pupils in the Netherlands are as good at maths as much better-off teenagers in France. The poorest 10% of pupils in Hong Kong scored at a higher level than the wealthiest in Sweden and Norway. The very lowest performers among this group were in the Slovak Republic. Mr Schleicher says it shows how academic differences attributed to social background should not be unquestioningly tolerated. \"We tend to overestimate the impact of poverty,\" he says. There was also a challenge to the idea that the UK has an unusually poor record on social mobility. Dr John Jerrim at the Institute of Education published a study suggesting that in international terms the UK was mid-ranking in the link between family background and future employment opportunities - 17th out of 34 developed countries. There was greater equity in Scandinavia and some European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands. But Dr Jerrim said social mobility in the UK was not dissimilar to France, Spain and Italy - and the UK's record was\n",

            "Input: summarize: With the Windies chasing 261, pace bowler Perry took a wicket in each of her first three overs to reduce the Caribbean side to 41-3. Merissa Aguilleira and Deandra Dottin briefly threatened some fireworks, but after both fell to Lisa Sthalekar, West Indies limped to 145 all out. Rachael Haynes (52) and Jess Cameron (75) had earlier made half-centuries for the Aussies, with some late-order hitting from Perry and Jodie Fields taking them to 259-7. By contributing with the bat and then starring with the ball, Perry made a dramatic return to the Southern Stars' line-up after three games out with an ankle injury. The last of those was an eight-run defeat by West Indies, their first win over Australia and the result that sealed their place in a maiden final. Because of that victory, Windies skipper Aguilleira said her side had a \"psychological advantage\" over the team that had lifted the trophy on five previous occasions. But Australia were too clinical for a West Indies side that were sloppy in the field, wayward with the ball and unable to keep up with the run chase. In reclaiming the trophy they last won in 2005, Australia add to the World Twenty20 they won in October and the Ashes they will try to defend in England in August. It is the first time they have held all three of women's cricket's major titles simultaneously. Only once in the match were they under pressure, as four wickets fell for 28 runs around the batting powerplay. \"If an emerging sport needs a star to help raise its profile, then women's cricket has struck gold with Ellyse Perry.

They will only apply to yellow cards shown for dissent, and will see players leave the field for 10 minutes. It will also be tested in Sunday League and male and female youth football. More than 1,000 clubs received emails over the weekend asking if they were willing to be part of the pilot process. \"There has already been a positive response with over 60 leagues in support of it,\" an FA spokesperson said. Clubs are normally charged a £10 fine for each yellow card but the FA will not be charging this administration fee for those that participate. Step seven is the bottom level of English football's National League System, which feeds into the country's professional leagues. The highest league within that structure - step one - is the National League. The move has been backed by teenage Sunday League referee Ryan Hampson, who earlier this year organised a nationwide strike by officials in protest at the amount of abuse they face in the grassroots game. \"There's obviously a lot more to be done but it's a step in the right direction and a great start,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live.\n",

The band had previously worked with the British Film Institute in sourcing archive recordings to sample, and they turned to BFI again in their hunt for material from the Cold War space race. \"At the time I called them up to ask them if they had any space footage they'd only just inherited it from another collection,\" said J Willgoose. \"One of my biggest concerns about writing this album was about finding the material for the Soviet missions. \"It was an incredible stroke of luck that the BFI happened to come across these films just as I started asking after them.\" A fan of space exploration, Willgoose was familiar with the battles between the USA and USSR to beat one another to historic firsts. The Soviets got the first satellite into space in the 1950s and the first man in the 1960s, while the Nasa's Apollo missions put the first men on the Moon. But Willgoose was still surprised by what was in the BFI's newly-acquired collection. He said: \"Most of the Soviet stuff was new to me - even now it's hard to find a great deal of good quality literature or footage of their missions because their space programme was shrouded in such secrecy. \"A good deal of the material from the Apollo missions I hadn't heard before - I really went very deep into the mission logs and dug out stuff that I hadn't heard of before. \"The public relations feed for the Apollo 8 lunar orbit was one of my favourite pieces of audio for the whole album.\" One of the tracks on the new album - The Race for Space - is dedicated to cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. However, in a strange twist the music ended up evoking an American theme. Willgoose said: \"I'd had this guitar riff lying around for a couple of years as I'd tried to use it on another song and it hadn't worked, and it was always at the back of my mind because I really liked it. \"Then when it came to matching up musical ideas that I'd had with likely topics for the album, and\n",

Figures from the NI Cancer Registry reveal there is a higher diagnosis rate among young people in Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK. Five charities have come together to provide a new service that includes five new nursing posts, one in each health trust. There are also social workers and community workers to guide young people at home, school and work. The service aims to ensure young people have equal clinical and psychological support for their medical and social needs no matter where they live. Figures also reveal that the amount of miles that local families, seeking support, clock up is the second highest compared to their counterparts elsewhere. Up until now, the service has been confined to the Belfast Cancer Centre and The Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children. Bridging that gap means the service will now be available in four hospitals including Belfast, Craigavon, Altnagelvin, Ulster and Antrim Area. That means fewer families will have to make the average 100 mile round trip to get treatment in Belfast. Leona McManus, 22, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year. \"Travelling while undergoing treatment is hard. You are tired, sick, often in pain. I had to travel from Limavady to Belfast. \"This new service means I can go to Altnagelvin - young people will also have a nurse, even a community worker.

He dispatched a penalty for his treble by the 30th minute and United could have had several more by half-time. Sean Welsh's penalty gave Thistle hope but United saw out the win comfortably. The hosts were sluggish in the first half of their Championship opener against Queen of the South on Saturday but there was nothing to fault the way they started this tie. United had too much pace and ingenuity for their top-flight opponents, the outstanding Scott Fraser and Tope Obadeyi causing havoc with their movement. Obadeyi, twice, and Blair Spittal might have added further goals by the interval but United boss Ray McKinnon manager must have been happy with the three they did score. Smith showed the benefit of a regular start on loan, taking his goal tally to four for the Terrors, the same number he scored in nearly 90 appearances for Aberdeen, though a high percentage of those outings were as a substitute. His first was a sublime finish, gathering a delicious Fraser pass, controlling the ball then steering it behind Ryan Scully. For his second, Smith picked up possession just inside the Thistle half, run away from Callum Booth then held off the defender to score when he got back to him in the box. The 20-year-old completed his hat trick with a penalty struck straight down the middle after Ziggy Gordon blocked Blair Spittal's shot with an arm. Thistle were given a glimpse of a way back from a penalty of their own when Chris Erskine was pushed over by Mark Durnan and Welsh scored with 25 minutes left, but United's defence held firm. United boss Ray McKinnon: \"We played some very good football in the first half, especially the forward play, and when the penalty was given against us in the second, I was really pleased with how we reacted.

It comes after controversy surrounding the conduct of undercover officers. Meanwhile, a separate review into the relationship between the Home Office and the SDS says a key file is missing. The inquiry announced on Thursday will also make recommendations about how undercover policing is conducted and will scrutinise the use of undercover officers by the now-defunct SDS and National Public Order Intelligence Unit. Among the allegations are that undercover officers took fake identities from dead children, had relationships with campaigners and fathered children. Mrs May said that the work of barrister Mark Ellison and Operation Herne - an investigation into undercover policing at the Metropolitan Police - has unearthed \"serious historical failings\" in undercover policing practices. Mr Ellison - who in 2012 successfully prosecuted Gary Dobson and David Norris for the murder of teenager Stephen Lawrence - has been examining police corruption during the original investigation into the killing in 1993. She added: \"As I said last year, I was profoundly shocked by Mark Ellison's findings and committed to establishing a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the SDS. \"While I initially said that Mark Ellison's further work and criminal investigations needed to conclude before the inquiry commences, it has become apparent that these pieces of work were much larger than initially envisaged. \"In the interest of learning the lessons of past failures, I have decided to establish the inquiry now while ensuring existing work is not affected. \"Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future.\" This latest inquiry will be led by judge Lord Justice Pitchford. Mrs May had announced her intention to set up a judge-led public inquiry following the report of the independent Ellison Inquiry in March last year.

Spectre and Skyfall took a total of five years to make, he told BBC Radio's Test Match Special. \"It feels almost, even though we've just finished shooting it, like one big experience and it was a fantastic life-changing thing,\" he said. But he added he did not think he could go through it again. \"It really is more a lifestyle choice than a job,\" he said. Mendes made his name in theatre, and directed a new stage production of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in between making the Bond films. But shooting a Bond movie is \"pretty much all encompassing\", he explained. \"I'm happiest rehearsing a play or editing a movie, and when I've finished editing a movie I generally want to be back in a theatre environment again,\" he said. \"It feels like home, it feels controllable after the chaos of a movie set. But it won't be long before I want to do another film, and I'm very fortunate to be able to go back and forth between the two.\" Spectre has been filmed in locations including London, Mexico, Italy and Morocco, and the cast and crew totalled more than 1,000 people, Mendes revealed. \"And you really do feel it,\" he said. \"This is a bigger movie than Skyfall. It's shot in more places - we were in Mexico City and Tangiers and northern Sahara and Rome and the Alps and London. It's been an enormous undertaking.\" Spectre also stars Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Andrew Scott, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Dave Bautista\n",

            "Input: summarize: A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth. The proposal to allow abortion in such cases was defeated by 59 votes to 40. The result followed a passionate debate at Stormont after some MLAs proposed the law change be introduced by way of an amendment to the Justice Bill. Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Politicians have been lobbied to reform the law since 2013, when Northern Ireland woman Sarah Ewart spoke out about having to travel to Great Britain for an abortion after she was told she was carrying a baby that had no chance of survival. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) faced criticism from other parties during Wednesday's debate for asking the Health Minister Simon Hamilton to set up a working group to examine the issues raised by fatal foetal abnormality. It could take six months for the group to complete its work and the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt claimed it was a DUP \"device\" to delay decision making on abortion reform until after May's assembly election. Justice Minister David Ford, who brought forward the proposed change to the legislation, told Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show it could now remain in limbo for some time. \"It would appear that that is what some people want, that it was any excuse at all to avoid taking a decision last night so they can fudge the issue,\" he said. \"We will wait and see what happens to the DUP's supposed working group for the next six months. Certainly, we'll get the DUP past the election, maybe that's why they're doing it.\" However, the DUP has argued that the issue required proper consideration by MLAs and ministers and that the Justice Bill was not intended for this purpose. The amendment to legalise abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality was proposed by Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson. He told MLAs: \"If we are to continue to fail women in Northern Ireland in this area then we are abdicating our duties as representatives.\n",

The north of England and parts of Wales are warned to prepare for the risk of flooding, as heavy rain approaches. There are amber warnings, meaning \"be prepared\", for Greater Manchester, and North and West Yorkshire. People in certain locations around Kendal and Egremont, on opposite sides of the Lake District, have been advised to move out to stay with family and friends who live in areas with lower risk of flooding. Reception centres have opened at Kendal Town Hall and West Lakes Academy. South Lakeland District Council said up to 1,000 properties could be at risk and that military personnel could be deployed to install temporary flood defences to protect vital infrastructure. The worst of the weather is expected from Saturday evening through to Sunday. In some places, a month's worth of rain has been forecast to fall in 24 hours. Falling on already saturated ground, it is likely to cause localised surface water flooding and high river levels, the Environment Agency said. The Met Office has also warned of possible flooding in parts of Scotland in the wake of Storm Abigail. Nicola Willis, from the Met Office, said high ground was likely to be most affected by heavy rain. \"These areas have had a lot of rain already this week and they are already quite saturated,\" she said. \"We are expecting the rain to be heavy and persistent, although the heaviest rain will not necessarily continue through the whole of the warning period.\" Cumbria was hit by severe floods in November 2009. During those incidents, Pc Bill Barker, 44, died after the bridge he was standing on collapsed in Workington, a town about 13 miles north of Egremont. Craig Woolhouse, from the Environment Agency, said it was working closely with emergency services to prepare for any problems. He added: \"Our teams are already in action clearing watercourses, maintaining existing defences and standing ready to deploy temporary pumps and defences where these can be effective.\" The latest band of rain comes in the wake of Storm Abigail, which closed schools and brought down power lines in parts of Scotland.

He is the fifth swimmer to manage a Rio 2016 qualification time, following Adam Peaty, Hannah Miley, James Guy and Max Litchfield.

Siobhan-Marie O'Connor warmed up for her favoured 200m individual medley event on Saturday with victory over Fran Halsall in the 100m freestyle in 54.18 secs. Two-time Olympian Lizzie Simmonds won 200m backstroke gold but her time of 2:09.24 was almost a second outside the qualifying time of 2:08.21. \"I know if I get that place that I can go quicker, as I've done it in the past,\" she said. \"I was fourth at the last Olympics, so perhaps it'll be a case of third time lucky.\" Freestyle specialist Guy followed up his 400m gold and Olympic place from Tuesday with victory in the 100m butterfly. He won in 52.15 secs, which, although outside the qualifying time of 51.24, he hopes will earn him a spot in the men's 4x100m medley relay team for Rio. \"Last year we were fourth [at the World Championships] and we hope that with the right mix we can potentially win a medal in Rio,\" Guy told BBC Radio 5 live.

More than a third of the UK's 195 female MPs took part in the research. Of these, two thirds said they felt \"less safe\" following the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox last summer. Deputy Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said Parliament was working with police to ensure MPs' safety and offer training to enhance their security while away from Westminster. The anonymous 5 Live survey, conducted last month, saw one respondent remarking that \"the level of violence and abuse has significantly increased in the last years. At times I have been very frightened.\" Another wrote: \"Had to phone the police once, [after] a constituent threatened to kill me.\" Following the murder of Mrs Cox, who represented Batley and Spen, one MP said she had received \"absolutely zero\" support from Parliament or her party. Another wrote: \"I asked my kids' view on whether I should stop after Jo's death, but their support was all I needed. Standing up to bullies is the only answer.\" \"I won't give in,\" wrote another.

Most people care about the fate of Greece, and hope that it can maintain stability and feel secure. Many people, but by no means all, believe that its membership of \"Club Europe\" is one guarantee of a stability which has so often been denied to Greece in the past. For at least the past hundred years, Greece has swung between democracy and dictatorship, between civilian and military rule, and the outside world would like to be sure the pendulum now stays firmly in the position marked \"democratic, civilian government\". Both history and geography help explain why Greece matters far beyond its borders. The society which gave the world the embryo of modern democracy in Ancient Greece has only enjoyed 40 years of continuous parliamentary democracy in modern times. The days of the \"Greek colonels\" are still in the not-very-distant past. The last military regime in Athens was overthrown in 1974. Thirty years earlier, in 1944, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, as uncomfortable wartime allies against the Nazis, were carving up the Balkans between East and West for the post-war era. In Moscow, Churchill put it to Stalin: \"Let us settle about our affairs in the Balkans.\" Britain's wartime leader wrote down his proposals in pencil on a sheet of paper: A couple of later additions and amendments in red ink are important. The Greece section is changed so that \"the others 10%\" becomes \"Russia 10%\". And after Great Britain's claim to 90% influence has been added the words \"in accord with USA\", recognising where the real post-war power would lie. It was part of the far larger, so-called \"percentages agreement\" attempting to parcel out Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Hungary too. There's a blue pencil tick near the top of the page, apparently in Stalin's hand.

George sits in his office outside the tiny Cornish village of Doublebois and patiently explains the macroeconomic forces at play that have reduced my car to a hunk of worthless metal. China, he reckons, is the problem. With Chinese demand falling, the price of iron ore is on the way down and scrap metal prices are following in their wake. A year ago George could have got £160 for my car. During the Beijing Olympics prices skyrocketed. Not now. \"There's a worldwide glut of metal,\" he explains.

Often, it said in a blogpost, the best answers to a query were found in an app rather than a web page. Initially nine apps have been selected to work with the streaming system as it is tested. Jennifer Lin, Google engineering manager, said the firm started indexing information found in apps two years ago to bolster its larger corpus of search data. About 40% of searches done via Google now turn up content found in apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb or Pinterest, she said. Until now, Google has only answered queries with information that is available both on the web and in apps. Now, however, it is starting to show results that are only found in apps. One example of when these results would show up might be when someone is looking for hotels during a spur-of-the-moment trip to an unfamiliar city, wrote Ms Lin in the blog. Google said it was using an in-house developed streaming system to give people access to results in apps they do not have installed on their Android handsets. This lets people try the app and use it as if it were installed, said Ms Lin. An experimental cloud-based virtualisation technology Google has developed underpins the streaming system. Apps from HotelTonight, Useful Knots, Daily Horoscope and Gormey are among the first to be available via streaming. Danny Sullivan, founding editor of the Search Engine Land news site, said the streaming system made visible a lot of information that was hard to get at easily. \"It's a bad experience to show links to an app that no-one can view unless they install an app,\" he said.

Mr Trump has also said he wants the US to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. But President Obama says this would see the US lose its \"seat at the table\". The President's views appeared in a policy forum article in the highly regarded research journal, Science. The editors believe it is the first time that a sitting President has written such a feature. In the article, the President argues that a \"massive scientific record\" shows that climate change is \"real and cannot be ignored\". Mr Obama also details the reasons he believes the trend towards a low-carbon economy is now \"irreversible\". He points to the fact that between 2008 and 2015 the US economy grew by 10% while emissions of CO2 fell by almost the same amount. Mr Obama says that US businesses have increasingly seen the financial benefits from cutting carbon through greater energy efficiency. Citing the examples of corporations like General Motors and Alcoa, the President says the US consumed 2.5% less energy in 2015 than in 2008 while the economy was now a tenth bigger. There would be a huge financial penalty if economies don't reduce their emissions, Mr Obama writes. If CO2 continues to rise then global temperatures could go up by 4 degrees C by the end of this century, and that could cost the world economy 4% of GDP. In US terms that would equate to the loss of federal revenue of between $340bn and $690bn every year. Pointedly, Mr Obama says that 2.2 million Americans now work in jobs connected to energy efficiency - double the 1.1 million that work in fossil fuel production and electricity generation. Thanks to hydraulic fracturing, gas has emerged as a transformative energy source, now accounting for 33% of US electricity production. Despite Mr Trump's plans to revive the coal industry by cutting red tape, \"it is unlikely that utilities will change course and choose to build coal-fired power plants, which would be more expensive than natural gas plants, regardless of any near-term changes in federal policy.\" Even states that supported Donald Trump in the presidential election had moved heavily to renewables. Iowa generated 32% of their electricity in 2015 from wind, up from 8% in 2008. On the Paris climate agreement, Mr Obama said this was\n",

Scottish GDP per person - which takes population changes into account - was also flat during the first quarter of 2016. During the first three months of the year services in Scotland grew by 0.4%, while production contracted by 1.2% and construction by 1.5%. On an annual basis, Scotland's economy grew by 0.6%, compared with UK growth of 2%. The figures were compiled by Scotland's chief statistician. The GDP figures were released on the same day as official data showed that unemployment in Scotland fell by 18,000 between March and May. A leading economic forecaster described the two sets of figures as \"a mixed bag\" for the Scottish economy. Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute at the University of Strathclyde, said growth had been \"stagnant\" over the first three months of the year. \"While the all-important services sectors grew, there was a sharp fall in production and construction,\" he said. \"Of greatest concern was the fall in manufacturing, which was down 2.6% over the three months and 5.4% over the year. This was the sharpest fall in annual manufacturing output since the 2008/09 financial crisis. \"On the plus side, revisions to the data paint a rosier picture of growth last year. The Scottish economy is now estimated to have grown in each and every quarter of 2015, with growth of 1.4% in 2015 up from the previous estimate of just +0.9%. \"Despite that, Scotland continued to lag behind the UK as a whole.\" Responding to the GDP figures, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce called for \"a concerted government response to Scotland's growth problems and swift clarification of the position of EU nationals working in the UK\". Chief executive Liz Cameron said: \"Scotland's growth has now been at a fraction of that of the UK as a whole for a full year and there are few signs of a major improvement in sight. \"In the light of the EU referendum result, the Scottish and UK governments must take all steps necessary to support businesses at this time and help them to invest for the future and get our economy back on the path of growth.\" The Federation of Small Businesses said the growth figures presented a challenge.

Mrs Carson later died at the scene from multiple injuries. Ferris admitted causing her death by dangerous driving. He was jailed for nine years and six months. Jailing Ferris at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Turnbull told him: \"Your behaviour on that evening, when seen in the context of your previous offending, demonstrates you have no sense of the civilised values by which others in our community live their lives.\" Lord Turnbull said Mrs Carson had been a mother and wife \"in the prime of her life\" who, through the random timing of taking her dog for a walk, found herself in the path of a drunk driver travelling at excessive speed. He said the author of a background report on Ferris could \"detect little by way insight or genuine remorse\" on his part. \"The consequence of your conduct was predictable, but it was also truly tragic for Mrs Carson and her family,\" he said. A previous hearing at the High Court in Glasgow was told that on the day of the crash Ferris had been drinking Buckfast and was \"pretty drunk\". At about 20:00, Mrs Carson left her home in Gresham View, Motherwell, to walk the family dog. Ferris was seen driving the Mondeo at excessive speed, causing some witnesses to remark that he was \"flying past\" and driving \"like an idiot\". He then lost control on Muirhouse Road, causing the car to mount the pavement, hit Mrs Carson and then smash into a wall. Afterwards, Ferris got out of the car and spoke to Mrs Carson who was lying on the pavement. What he said was not heard, but a bystander then saw him put his hands to his head and shout before running from the scene. One of the people who tried to help Mrs Carson called the mobile number on the dog's collar and spoke to 47-year-old Mr Carson. He then rushed to the scene with their 11-year-old daughter and both were comforted by locals while a nurse attempted CPR on Mrs Carson until paramedics arrived.

And I think respect comes with age - people take you more seriously.\" It certainly worked for Johnson. It was as she was turning 40 that she set up the San Francisco-based product design company, Coupage, with her engineer husband. Business has been booming ever since. She is not alone, it seems. Many women entrepreneurs are waiting for the right moment, and are starting their businesses in their forties or beyond - as a second or even third career - having bided their time until they are absolutely ready. Having worked in product design and then in advertising, Raquel Johnson realised that she did not want to return to the corporate world after she had her younger daughter. It was challenging walking away from the \"sure thing\" of a steady salary, she says, but she also found it liberating. She has found her \"true passion,\" she says. \"Even the stress I feel now is more enjoyable,\" she explains cheerfully. \"It motivates me and pushes me forward.\" Starting small, the business was run from home and was self-funded at first. \"[When you are older] there is more opportunity for some savings to have accumulated,\" points out Johnson. \"You don't have to take out large loans or search for funders right away.\" Having started with a prototype for a device to integrate an iPod into a car, Coupage has grown steadily, bringing ideas to life in the fields of audio, energy, cars and Apple-related products. \"Once you reach your forties you have the confidence to follow your own path,\" says the US-born businesswoman, Karen Scofield, who set up her company when she was 46. A sense of humour is also important, she adds with a smile. In the early days, she had to run her firm, London-based fashion brand Lucza, single-handedly. It was all down to her, from technology mishaps and admin dramas to sudden, urgent errands, like dashing out to the shop to buy a copier cartridge. \"Humour was definitely needed on that day,\" she laughs.

            "Input: summarize: DUP leader Arlene Foster said the \"wide-ranging\" pact was \"good for Northern Ireland and the UK\" - so where will the money be spent? The heart of the financial package is infrastructure spending - £400m of it over two years. That is a significant sum given that Northern Ireland's annual infrastructure budget is about £1bn. The deal specifically mentions the York Street Interchange, a project to ease congestion where three major roads meet in Belfast. It is expected to cost about £150m, so there should be plenty left over for other major projects. They could include a planned transport hub in the centre of Belfast and other major roads schemes like the completion of the A5 or A6. On top of the £400m, there is a further £150m for ultra-fast broadband. This was a project which was already being scoped by the Department of the Economy before the collapse of Stormont. It is ultimately about improving the connectivity of rural businesses. Previous Stormont/Westminster deals have also included infrastructure but they typically involved allowing Stormont to borrow more. This time it is cold, hard, no-strings-attached cash. The money for health and education is more modest - given that a figure of £1bn for health alone was being mentioned during the negotiations. There is a minimum of £250m for health and and we can assume it will get about half the \"immediate pressures\" money, bringing it to a total of £300m. That will help ease the problems with waiting lists and give the system some breathing space ahead of a major reform programme. The \"immediate pressures\" money for education (about £50m) will go some way to easing a growing row with head teachers who have said they will not impose any more cuts. There is also £100m to be spent on deprived communities over five years. It will be interesting to see what the delivery mechanism for that money will be. Stormont's Social Investment Fund, which was also designed to help those communities, has been mired in controversy. Another part of this deal is to give flexibility to a previously agreed £500m fund for investment in shared education and housing projects. Stormont has struggled to spend this money, in its first year just £3m of a £50m allocation was spent. So its is possible that the\n",

This time, both models feature displays that curve round the phones' sides. The launch follows Samsung's botched release of the Note 7, which was recalled twice after fires. The South Korean firm blamed the problem on battery faults and said it had since put in additional safety measures, including X-ray scans of batteries. The company has also become mired in a corruption scandal in its home country. \"The Galaxy S8 is arguably the most important launch of the last 10 years for Samsung and every aspect will be under the microscope following the Note 7 recall,\" commented Ben Wood from the CCS tech consultancy. \"The S8 is a unquestionably a strong product but Samsung must now deliver a faultless launch to move on from its earlier difficulties. If this happens it will emerge in an even stronger position.\" The new devices will be released on 21 April. The S8 is priced at £690 and the S8+ at £780 - a jump on last year's entry prices of £569 for the S7 and £639 for the S7 Edge. Samsung was the bestselling handset manufacturer for 2016 as a whole, according to market research firm IDC. However, Apple overtook it in the final three months. Source: IDC The displays of the S8 and S8+, measuring 5.8in (14.7cm) and 6.2in (15.7cm) respectively, mean a more stretched aspect ratio than before, pushing the screens closer to the top and bottom of the handsets. As a consequence, Samsung's logo no longer features on the front, and the physical home button is replaced with an on-screen icon - in a similar manner to rival Android phones from Huawei and LG. A pressure sensor and vibration module have, however, been built into the space behind the new virtual button to provide feedback. Samsung suggests the displays' 18.5:9 ratio makes them better suited to running two apps side by side. For example, there is now space to watch a video, use a chat app and still have room for a full touch-keyboard.

The glass roof of the conference centre was dark with snow. But since then, a remarkable set of changes has allowed the Paris Agreement to take shape. Paris climate deal enters force as focus shifts to action UN review says carbon plans fall well short of climate goals For a start, the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and US, jointly decided to make a serious push. For President Obama, this has always been a priority. And for China the new middle class is demanding an end to the toxic pollution smothering the biggest cities. And that's spurred another shift: renewable energy is falling in price. Out in the deserts of western China, along the ancient Silk Road, I've seen for myself new forests of wind turbines. Recently, China has planted two of them every hour. The Chinese push for renewable energy is the largest the world has ever seen. And look at the global figure for solar panels installed last year - it was half a million every day. A third big change is the involvement of leading companies. A decade ago, it was rare for me to get a corporate press release making a green boast. Now my inbox is bursting with them. On Friday, 10 oil companies announced a one-billion-dollar fund for low-carbon technology - something inconceivable not long ago but, let's be clear, the sum is dwarfed by the money spent developing new sources of oil. So will the Paris Agreement get anywhere? On the one hand, it doesn't oblige any government to cut their greenhouse gases. But, on the other, each country's efforts will be scrutinised every five years. And although the agreement has no teeth, it does represent something unique: the first time that every nation on the planet has signed up to try to head off the worst effects of global warming.\n",

The Warriors, for whom captain John Bateman scored a late consolation, would have gone top themselves with a win but defeat left them third.

Warrington, who lost winger Tom Lineham to a head injury early in the first half, saw off a burst of Wigan pressure before Atkins' close-range try stretched the lead to 20 points and his second effectively killed the contest.

Under the proposals, strategic planning, transport and economic regeneration powers would be handed over. The Chancellor, George Osborne, could announce the plan on Wednesday. The five West Yorkshire councils - Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds and Wakefield - joined the neighbouring City of York in North Yorkshire to form a combined authority six months ago. Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield councils have created a similar South Yorkshire body. The existing councils would continue to run services such as education and waste management individually. Under the current agreement one of the council leaders is chosen by the others to chair the combined authority. The chancellor's idea takes this on much further with extra powers for the combined authority to control social welfare policy, raise tax and control public spending. In return leadership would be given to a new generation of \"metro mayors\" wielding considerable executive powers. Councillor Peter Box, Labour leader of Wakefield City Council and current chair of the West Yorkshire Combined Authority, said he would welcome any extra power and budgets but totally reject a regional executive mayor. Wakefield, Bradford, Leeds and Sheffield all rejected individual city mayors in referendums just two years ago. \"Just a couple of weeks ago the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was in Leeds and told us that we could have the devolved powers without having to accept an executive mayor,\" said Mr Box. \"Go on any street and it becomes clear the public will simply not accept another elected politician.\" Andrew Carter, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on Leeds City Council, voted against creating a local executive mayor in the 2012 referendums. \"But, a metro mayor is a completely different proposition,\" he said. Support for the idea has come from two of Bradford's MPs.

He boasted about his crimes in online posts, saying in one discussion that \"impoverished kids are definitely much easier to seduce than middle-class Western kids.\" Ahead of his sentencing, Huckle claimed to a psychiatrist that he wanted to put his \"madness\" behind him and settle down with a south Indian woman. But the court was shown a posting from 2013 in which he outlined his plan to marry one of his victims in order to help him abuse more children.

Former British PM Tony Blair also paid tribute describing the Nobel Peace prize winner as \"a political giant\". Mr Peres died aged 93 on Tuesday, two weeks after suffering a stroke. He was one of the last of a generation of Israeli politicians present at the new nation's birth in 1948, serving twice as the country's prime minister and once as president. He also won the Nobel Peace prize in 1994 for his role negotiating peace accords with the Palestinians a year earlier.

Princess Charlotte was born on Saturday in London's St Mary's Hospital, weighing 8lbs 3oz (3.7kg). The Queen met her new great-granddaughter at Kensington Palace for the first time on Tuesday. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said a cot blanket made from Tasmanian merino wool was being sent on behalf of the Australian people to mark the royal birth. It was made at the country's oldest weaving mill, Waverly Woollen Mills, Tasmania, and has been embroidered with the Australian floral emblem, the wattle. Mr Abbott said his government would also be making a A$10,000 (£5,200) donation to the Healesville Sanctuary, in Victoria, in honour of the princess. \"I hope one day the princess can visit Australia and hold a Mountain Pygmy-possum herself,\" he said. The Mountain Pygmy-possum is Australia's only hibernating marsupial, and there are fewer than 2,000 left in the wild. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and his wife Nechama Rivlin wished the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge \"joy, health and happiness\" at the birth. They have sent a beaded brooch which features a heart-shaped charm and the \"hamsa\" symbol - a Middle Eastern sign of protection - as well as a dress, according to a statement from Rivlin's office. Sharona Barzilai, who designed the dress, said: \"For me this closes a circle as I learned to be a dressmaker in London, and I am delighted that my design has been sent as a present to the new princess.\" Meanwhile, a Lego figure of Princess Charlotte has been added to the Buckingham Palace model at Legoland Windsor. More than 7,000 souvenir mugs are being produced at the Emma Bridgewater factory in Stoke-on-Trent to mark the birth of the princess, whose name - Charlotte Elizabeth Diana - was announced on Monday.

The Outlet opened on the outskirts of Banbridge in County Down in 2007, but was effectively taken over by Ulster Bank in 2011. Junction One opened near Antrim in 2004. Ulster Bank also lent the money for that development. The Outlet is currently held by an Ulster Bank company called West Register (Northern Ireland) Property. It is a Northern Ireland branch of a group of companies set up by the bank's parent company RBS to hold \"distressed properties\". Earlier this year another West Register firm sold the Richmond Centre in Londonderry. The Outlet was opened in 2007 at a cost of £70m but struggled to fill all its units. There are plans to switch part of its use from retail to leisure with a cinema and restaurants. The last set of accounts for the company that holds Junction One valued the development at £7.85m, compared to a valuation of almost £80m in 2009. Junction One Ltd had Ulster Bank borrowings of about £48m and its liabilities outweigh its assets by £53m.

But Hurricane Julio, a Category 3 storm with winds of more than 120mph, is about 1,000 miles (1,609km) away. Hawaiian officials have urged residents to stock up on emergency supplies. The last cyclone to hit Hawaii, Hurricane Iniki in 1992, killed six and caused $2.4bn (£1.4bn) in damage. Five to eight inches of rain are forecast, along with heavy winds and potential flash flooding in some parts of the state. The storm was weakening as it hit the terrain of the eastern-most island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, according to Chris Brenchley, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Honolulu. \"As wind blows into the terrain, the terrain kind of redirects the wind,\" he said. The state's department of emergency management has asked residents to prepare a seven-day emergency kit, including non-perishable food and water. Hawaii's remoteness from the mainland makes it hard to get emergency supplies to the state. Stores have had to quickly restock bottled water and other supplies. The storm has already knocked out power for more than 18,000 people on the Big Island, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. Another 2,700 were without power on the island of Maui. At least 50 flights from major airlines were canceled on Thursday and an inter-island airline cancelled all of its flights on Friday. Rudy Cruz and Ashley Dochnahl from California told the Associated Press they had attempted to fly back early but failed to secure a flight. \"We were trying to beat it, but we now will have to ride it out,\" Mr Cruz said. Big Island resident Andrew Fujimura said the waves were topping 20ft (6m) along the coast. \"I can't say I'm too worried,\" he said. \"Worst-case scenario, the power may go out a day or two.

Asked if he would end the ban on secondary strike action - also known as solidarity action - brought in by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government in 1990, Mr Corbyn said: \"Yes, of course\". He added: \"Nobody willingly goes on strike. They go on strike as an ultimate weapon... So let's look at the causes of people being upset rather than the symptoms.\" Reaction to Sunday's political interviews Mr Corbyn also did not rule out allowing the return of flying pickets - where workers travels to support others' action - which were first used in the coal disputes of the 1970s. He said: \"It was merely people moving around showing support during a very difficult industrial dispute.\" Referring to the walkout by junior doctors in their dispute with the government about a new contract, Mr Corbyn said they \"would be better served if we had a health secretary who was prepared to get involved, meet them and look for a solution\". There were calls for the laws on secondary strikes to be repealed in 2005 while Labour was in power, amid action by baggage handlers at Heathrow Airport in support of sacked staff at the catering firm Gate Gourmet.

In the meantime, it's looking bleak for the Black Cats of Sunderland at the other end of the table. After 10 games, they have just two points in the bag, are bottom of the pile and have just a 19% chance of avoiding the drop into the Championship. Gracenote say they will finish on 28 points, well adrift of safety, although they will not be the worst side in Premier League history. They will not even be the worst Sunderland side in the top flight. The Black Cats managed 15 points in 2005-06 and 19 in 2002-03, relegated to the Championship on both occasions. There is a sliver of hope for Sunderland boss David Moyes, though. Crystal Palace and Everton managed just three points from their opening 10 matches in the 2013-14 and 1994-95 seasons respectively but stayed up. For the record, the worst Premier league performers are Derby County, who collected just 11 points - one win and eight draws - in 2007-08. It will perhaps come as no surprise to learn that Leicester City's hopes of retaining their crown are already over. According to Gracenote, the Foxes have a 0.1% chance of emulating their success of last season. Currently 11th, they are predicted to finish eighth. It is looking bleak, too, for Manchester United. Their title chances are rated at just 1.3% by Gracenote, who think Jose Mourinho's side will finish in sixth on 64 points, well adrift of the top four. That is one place lower and two points fewer than last season, which ended with an FA Cup victory but with manager Louis van Gaal losing his job. Worse news for United fans is that neighbours Manchester City will finish top, pipping Arsenal on goal difference. Gracenote predicted City and the Gunners would battle it out for the title before the season started and the duo are currently locked on 23 points at the top. Liverpool have also collected 23 points thanks to seven wins and two draws from their opening 10 games, but Gracenote predicts Jurgen Klopp's side will ultimately finish three points back in third. \"Liverpool are still improving and we may be underestimating\n",

Lt Col Leibovich said the militants had opened fire on the soldiers after crossing the border from Sinai. The troops were guarding a site where work is continuing on a new security barrier along the border with Egypt. The violence comes amid a crackdown by Egypt on Islamist militants operating in the Sinai Peninsula, launched after an attack last month left 16 Egyptian soldiers dead. In that incident, the militants subsequently crossed the border with Israel in an apparent attempt to carry out another attack. However, they were killed in Israeli air strikes. In June, militants fired an anti-tank missile at a vehicle convoy carrying construction workers helping to build the new border fence. One Israeli construction worker and two of the attackers were killed. Analysts say that the security situation in Sinai has deteriorated following the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last year, and that local Bedouin criminal gangs, radical Palestinian groups and possibly militant Islamists sympathetic to al-Qaeda have gained a foothold. By Kevin ConnollyBBC News, Jerusalem Israel's border with Egypt in the baking, hostile wilderness of the Sinai desert was among the most dangerous flashpoints in the Middle East until the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979. They had been to war four times there in the previous 30 years. Under Anwar Sadat and then Hosni Mubarak, Egypt kept an iron grip on the region offering Israel such strategic certainty that the border between the two countries was not properly fenced. Since the fall of Mubarak concern is deepening in Israel that Egypt is less able, or less willing to maintain the same degree of control. There have been a series of incursions over the last year - in the most serious, militants killed 16 Egyptian soldiers before blasting their way through the border fence. Israel fears more - and is building a fence which will run the entire length of the frontier. This latest attack came at one of the last points where work is still to be completed.

The far northwest of America, the Arctic, the western Pacific, and east Asia witnessed the entire passage. While the UK and the rest of Europe, the Middle East, and eastern Africa waited for local sunrise to try to see the closing stages of the transit.

Some of the best pictures of the event were provided by the US space agency's (Nasa) Solar Dynamics Observatory, which studies the Sun from a position 36,000km above the Earth. \"We get to see Venus in exquisite detail because of SDO's spatial resolution,\" said agency astrophysicist Dr Lika Guhathakurta. \"SDO is a very special observatory. It takes images that are about 10 times better than a high-definition TV and those images are acquired at a temporal cadence of one every 10 seconds. This is something we've never had before.\" Many citizens keen to observe the transit first hand attended special events at universities and observatories where equipment for safe viewing had been set up.

Smith used a passport in his birth name, Phillip Traynor, to fly to Chile and then go to Brazil on 6 November. He escaped while on a three-day release from a prison south of Auckland. Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 after he murdered the father of a 13-year-old boy he had sexually abused between 1992 and 1995. The family had moved house but he had tracked the boy to their new home in Wellington in December 1995. He repeatedly stabbed the father, killing him. The boy managed to escaped and raise the alarm. The victim, who is now 30, told New Zealand's Fairfax media after news of Smith's capture, that he could now stop sleeping with a knife under his pillow. \"It's great news, it's excellent,\" he said from his new home in Australia. \"[I feel] relief, a bit of peace of mind that I can carry on with my life without having that fear over my shoulder.\" Smith's escape has thrown Corrections and various other government agencies into controversy. It has led to calls for an overhaul of short-term prison release and the monitoring of high-risk offenders. In an email Smith sent to Radio New Zealand he said he had planned the escape by running a criminal check on his birth name and discovering that it had not been red-flagged. \"My only anxiety was that somebody that knew me might happen to be at the airport at the same time to identify me,'' he wrote, according to Radio NZ. He also said he had been able to fund the escape with money from various businesses he had run from prison. Smith said he chose Brazil because he thought it would be more difficult to extradite him if he was caught, as the two countries do not have a formal extradition treaty. He was arrested after a member of the public in Rio De Janeiro recognised him from images being circulated in hostels and tipped off police.

A judge said West was clearly suffering from mental health problems at the time of the outburst. She received a mental health treatment order for assaulting a constable in a separate incident.

            "Input: summarize: Hull keeper Eldin Jakupovic saved two penalties after the hosts had played the whole of extra time with 10 men following Dieumerci Mbokani's dismissal. Newcastle had taken the lead in extra time when Mohamed Diame prodded home Vurnon Anita's cross to score against his former club. The lead lasted a minute, Robert Snodgrass equalising after Matz Sels had spilled Markus Henriksen's shot into his path. Mbokani was sent off in the 89th minute for lunging forward with his head at Jamaal Lascelles. The tie only came to life in extra time, the first 90 minutes featuring just two shots on target. Newcastle have now lost nine of their 10 penalty shootouts in all competitions, yet Rafael Benitez's side will be wondering why they did not win the tie in 120 minutes. They had 32 shots in that time, but their finishing was as wayward as their penalties. Jonjo Shelvey set the tone for Newcastle's spot-kick nightmare when his attempt was kept out by Jakupovic. Hull's first penalty fell to Snodgrass and he made no mistake, before Dwight Gayle hit the bar with his attempt for Newcastle. Skipper Michael Dawson made it 2-0 before Christian Atsu scored for Newcastle. Tom Huddlestone made it 3-1, and Hull's players and fans were celebrating a first EFL Cup semi-final appearance when Jakupovic kept out Yoan Gouffran's tame attempt. Hull had just one shot on target in normal time, and their hopes of reaching the semi-finals looked over when Mbokani was sent off. The forward, on loan from Dynamo Kiev, kicked out and pushed Lascelles before lunging forward at the Newcastle defender with his head. The 31-year-old has appeared in five league games since arriving at the end of August. He now faces a three-match ban - something Hull could do without as they look to climb away from the Premier League relegation zone.

In a recording obtained by the Mail On Sunday, Mr Smith made offensive remarks about gay people, other UKIP members and Chigwell in Essex. He later issued a \"wholehearted and unreserved apology\". UKIP leader Nigel Farage told BBC News that Mr Smith had resigned \"by mutual consent\", and described his behaviour as \"loutish and wholly inappropriate\". He said UKIP had had \"great difficulty\" with the Basildon selection, adding: \"The party has got to grip this and sort it out, in short order\". Mr Farage also said UKIP's national executive committee had the power to impose a candidate if it wanted. UKIP hopes to make a serious challenge for the South Basildon and East Thurrock seat in the forthcoming general election, in which it is seeking to win a handful of seats and potentially hold the balance of power. But Mr Smith's resignation, four days after he was re-adopted as a candidate, capped a week of negative headlines for the party. Mr Hamilton pulled out of contention for the seat amid questions raised by the party over his expenses while another candidate, Natasha Bolter, withdrew amid an investigation into allegations she made against Mr Bird, whose job is to vet election candidates. Following his resignation on Sunday, Mr Smith said in a statement: \"I want the best for South Basildon and Thurrock and I want to see the real issues discussed that touch the lives of people. \"Therefore I have chosen to resign so that UKIP can win this seat next May.\" A parliamentary candidate resigns having tried blaming his racist comments on taking painkillers. This comes days after an alleged sex scandal at UKIP Head Office in which the party's chief executive did - or did not - sleep with another candidate. Meantime a wealthy donor is said to be threatening to stop funding the party if his friend doesn't get a seat. You may think that UKIP's week of bad headlines is just a diverting soap opera.

Hamid Aboutalebi was a part of the Muslim student group that seized the US embassy in Tehran in 1979. The White House has told Iran Mr Aboutalebi was \"not viable\" but has not taken a position on the bill. Fifty-two Americans were held for 444 days at the height of Iran's Islamic revolution, which saw pro-American Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi sent into exile and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini take power. Mr Aboutalebi, who previously served as Iran's ambassador to Belgium, the European Union, Italy and Australia, told Iranian media his participation in the hostage crisis began only after the initial seizure of the embassy, and primarily involved translation. On Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said, \"We've made clear and have communicated to the Iranians that the selection they've put forward is not viable.\" But he declined to say whether President Barack Obama would sign the bill into law. The Iranian government, meanwhile, has called the US rejection of Mr Aboutalebi \"not acceptable\". The bill passed on Thursday in the House denies entry into the US to individuals engaged in espionage or terrorism or who pose a threat to national security. Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who introduced the legislation in the US Senate, urged Mr Obama to sign the bill. \"We, as a country, can send an unequivocal message to rogue nations like Iran that the United States will not tolerate this kind of provocative and hostile behaviour,\" Mr Cruz said.

Pope Francis also met elderly survivors of the camp, kissing them on the cheeks and speaking to them softly. He is on his third day of a visit marking 1,050 years since Poland's adoption of Christianity. Francis has become the third Pope to walk through the main gate of Auschwitz, under its infamous inscription \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" - work sets you free. But unlike his German and Polish predecessors, he is not speaking about the horrors that occurred there, says the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw. Francis passed under the gates alone, wearing white robes and skullcap. After meeting the survivors, he placed a candle at the Death Wall, where prisoners were executed by the Nazis, before continuing on his own. The Pope stopped to pray at the prison cell of Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish Catholic friar who sacrificed his life to save that of another man. The Church made him a saint in 1982. Pope Francis knelt for many minutes in the underground cell, illuminated only by the light from a tiny window, the Associated Press news agency reports. The Argentine Pope is on a five-day trip to Poland. During a World Youth Day rally in the southern city of Krakow on Thursday, he urged compassion for migrants.

The two institutions already offer 10 joint professorships and several joint PhD programmes through Transcampus. However, its dean, Prof Stefan Bornstein, has told Times Higher Education that plans for the new King's campus are already \"in the process\". Prof Bornstein, who is director and chairman of TU Dresden's department of medicine and an honorary consultant in diabetes and endocrinology at King's, said the plan would allow King's to have a presence in Europe and maintain access to European research funding post-Brexit. Likewise, he said, TU Dresden would benefit from increased ties to London, one of the \"leading academic centres in the world\". Prof Bornstein said the new campus would hopefully run new undergraduate courses \"linked to innovation and the needs of industry and society\". The aim would be to recruit leading scholars from around the world, he added. Prof Bornstein said the Transcampus project had been envisaged before the EU referendum but admitted that it had become \"a lot more interesting\" since the vote. \"We cannot allow things that have developed for so many years in a positive way [to be] hampered by political decisions that actually nobody wanted,\" he said. \"It's a nice way to have a solution to get around this very stupid Brexit idea.\" A number of UK universities are believed to be considering opening branch campuses in Europe after Brexit - though earlier this year Oxford University rejected reports that it was in talks to open a Paris campus. Prof Bornstein said he would expect the Transcampus model to be replicated by other universities in the UK and Europe, but stressed that the key was a long history of collaboration between researchers at the two institutions.

He began as a record-breaking junior world champion powerlifter. Then, after suffering a serious spinal injury, he embarked on an illustrious handcycling career. Marsden raced on the European circuit while based in the Czech Republic, before a neck problem again saw him admitted into the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in 2009 for what he thought was a prolapsed disc. Instead it was revealed that he suffers with a rare motor-neurone condition which affects his arms, legs and brain. \"Through powerlifting I damaged my back many years ago, and after that I managed to damage my neck and had a couple of plates and (carbon) cage put in,\" the 44-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent told BBC East Midlands Today. In a matter-of-fact manner, Marsden says his sporting journey \"has not been an easy one\". When handcycling was no longer an option, he took up air rifle shooting and set his sights on London 2012, but while more representative honours came his way, he missed out on the Paralympics. Eventually, he turned to the water where he was able to combine aspects of his his first two sporting loves - powerlifting and handcycling - together in one explosive sport. \"I didn't want to give up on sport,\" he said. \"The cycling and powerlifting work quite well with the para-canoe - the gym work, the power and strength and then you have the endurance and speed work on the bike.\" The two-time para-canoe European champion and two-time world silver medallist now wants to realise his Paralympic ambition in Brazil when the British line-up is decided at the trials in Nottingham in June. \"It would be the highlight of my sporting career,\" Marsden said. \"As a kid I watched TV and watched the Olympics. I've seen how the Paralympics has built up over the years, from not really knowing what it was about to the status it has now, with athletes being household names. \"It would be an honour to\n",

The French mandate ended in 1943, after 23 years of colonial rule, ushering in the new republic. But it was in the 1950s that architecture, interior and product design flourished fusing European and Arab influences. The economic emphasis shifted from agriculture to industry, tourism and trade, creating a new skyline, and growing consumerism encouraged brand advertising. A 1960s poster (pictured) for Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national carrier, which began flying the newly wealthy to international destinations. The French-designed poster suggests it's made of mosaic while appearing modern, and designer Jacques Auriac - also responsible for the creating iconic French cigarette packets - conjured up posters to destinations beyond the immediate region. Opening its doors in late 1967, the boutique L'Artisan du Liban et L'Orient was the response of May El Khoury, the wife of an eminent architect, to the trauma of defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The defeat eroded confidence and left a profound impression on the Arab psyche. Modernising overlooked local crafts and selling them in a chic setting might be interpreted as an act of cultural activism. It softened the humiliation of military defeat for the middle classes, who were attracted to the new Arab aesthetic and to the idea of patriotism through ethical consumerism. The desire to create a contemporary Islamic architecture marked architect Assem Salam's early career in reaction to the 1967 war. Along with Pierre Khoury he felt the construction of specifically Lebanese-Arab religious buildings would revive spirits crushed by the defeat and designed the Khashoggi Mosque (pictured above). After the civil war he founded an association for the preservation of historic buildings seeking to slow down the rush to reconstruct Beirut at the cost of cultural heritage. The nightclub known as B 018 was designed by Bernard Khoury in 1998 in the Quarantaine, the Beirut neighbourhood that saw some of the worst atrocities during the conflict. It has its roots in the 1980s in the thick of the civil war when gatherings were held at\n",

But before I'm accused of completely failing to perform basic contractual duties, allow me to explain why those seven words are rather important. Since 2013, the BBC and almost every other leading news organisation in the UK has been locked in a bizarre battle to tell you the truth about Erol Incedal. \"Who he?\" I hear you ask. He's a student from London who was accused of preparing some kind of major terrorism plan. And then after two trials he was found not guilty of that allegation. But I can't tell you why. The prosecution of Erol Incedal has been, without a shadow of a doubt, the strangest criminal trial that those of us who report on the law have ever seen. Apologies. I meant to write \"not really seen much of\" because almost all of what happened was behind closed doors. And now the Court of Appeal has ruled that the unprecedented gagging order in the case will remain in place forever. Incedal was charged with another man, Mounir Rarmoul Bouhadjar, in October 2013. Rarmoul Bouhadjar admitted possessing bomb-making plans. Incedal denied the allegation, saying he had a reasonable excuse for holding them. In 2014, a jury convicted him of that, but they failed to agree whether he was guilty of a more serious charge of preparing an act of terrorism. At a retrial the following year, a fresh jury cleared him. I don't know why that jury cleared him. If I did, I couldn't tell you. Some of my colleagues do however know. But they can't tell me. Or you. They'd be in Contempt of Court and could end up in prison. Erol Incedal's trials involved an unprecedented level of secrecy in courts that are normally open to the public. There were brief periods of public evidence and then slightly longer periods when a group of accredited journalists were allowed in to listen to some of the mysterious evidence. The third and highest level of the case operated in complete secrecy, with the media totally banned. At the end of each secret session that journalists could attend, police took their notebooks and put them in a safe. Where are those notebooks now? You know\n",

Lowry-Huws' wife Susan, 63, who got a suspended sentence, must pay back the largest amount of £75,790. The three were convicted of conspiracy to defraud along with two others. At a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Mold Crown Court, it was agreed Antony Lowry-Huws and Whalley made £4m each from their crimes. Lowry-Huws was ordered to repay £27,905, while developer Whalley will give back £18,350. His wife, who was said to be on the periphery of the scam and under the influence of her husband, benefited £896,351 and must pay back £75,790. During the trial, the court heard mortgage lenders were conned into lending thousands of pounds in mortgages on properties across north Wales, Cheshire and the north west of England. The prosecution said the deceit was achieved by inflating the value of the property used as security, hiding that in some cases no deposit was put down, or inflating the rental income potential to make the mortgage rate more acceptable. In some cases the homes on which mortgages were advanced did not exist.\n",

Alastair Campbell has warned Labour risks \"driving itself off a cliff\" if Mr Corbyn is elected. Tony Blair's former spokesman is urging support for \"anyone but Corbyn\" in the leadership vote, arguing that the Islington North MP could never win a general election. Mr Corbyn, a backbencher who was seen as a rank outsider at the start of the campaign, has been packing out meeting halls across the UK, with many of his supporters joining the Labour Party to vote for him. The party has gained 79,000 members since the general election and 145,000 registered supporters. If the findings of the YouGov poll were repeated in the leadership election, Mr Corbyn would win without the need for second preferences to be counted. YouGov president Peter Kellner said he \"would personally be astonished if Corbyn does not end up as Labour's leader\" despite voting not starting until Friday and the result not being declared until 12 September. But others were warning about reading too much into one poll, given the difficulties of carrying out a representative survey of Labour's membership and those who have signed up as party supporters. Joe Twyman, also from YouGov, cautioned that the poll was a snapshot and there was still \"a lot to play for\" for all of the candidates in the race. \"The ballot papers haven't gone out, we've still got a month to go. What it shows to me is that there's a lot of movement on our previous poll and there still could be a lot of movement in the remaining four weeks,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One.

The vandalism was discovered on Wednesday, and the work is currently being cleaned. Kapoor called the incident \"a tragedy\". Speaking to Le Figero, he said the vandals represented \"a small fraction of people who have been told that any creative act is an endangerment of a sacred past, revered to the extreme.\" The installation, called Dirty Corner, sits in the grounds outside the palace, the home of Marie Antoinette, the 18th Century queen of France. He stressed to the newspaper he had never used the word \"queen\" to refer to the subject of the sculpture, and claimed he had been mis-quoted. Kapoor was originally quoted in a French interview saying the work signified \"the vagina of the queen coming into power\" - but later said the work was open to interpretation. \"Inevitably, one comes across the body, our bodies and a certain level of sexuality. But it is certainly not the only thing it is about,\" he said. In a statement, the artist added: I am aware of the power of art and its ability to offend. Dirty Corner is in some ways itself an act of artistic violence. \"It attempts to lay bare the tidy surface of Le Notre's Versailles...

However, if they do, they will have done it the hard way, because the first-day performance with the bat was below their best, with too many players getting in, then getting out. All the talk surrounding England after their convincing win in the first Test concerned the prospect of them finding some consistency, particularly with the bat. Could they nail another good performance to put this series out of South Africa's reach? On this first day in Cape Town, they had the opportunity to do just that after winning the toss and batting first in ideal conditions on a good pitch. But too many of the top order - Alastair Cook, Alex Hales, Nick Compton and Joe Root - did the hard part and then got out. England want to play freely and busily, they want to be ticking along and that is a fair enough approach. But allied to that is the need to build a careful platform, especially when so many things are in your favour. In these conditions, four wickets down at the close would have been about right, so it can be argued that England lost one too many. That they ended the day with the upper hand was thanks to Stokes who, after a relatively lean spell, once again showed what a fine cricketer he is with an unbeaten 74. The Durham man is a proper all-rounder, always ready to contribute with bat and ball. If one part of his game isn't firing, then he will probably deliver with the other. On top of that, he is a brilliant fielder. Stokes is a fierce competitor and he further demonstrated that in the way he shredded the second new ball late in the day. South Africa had built up to that point, putting all their eggs in one basket in the hope that more wickets would come. For Stokes to then smash the ball around must have been pretty deflating. Yes, he took a chance, but he also created his own luck. He forced South Africa to remove their catchers and go on the defensive. It is performances like this that show Stokes to be a rarity in the world game. It's\n",

This was down from 3.7 million, or 17.9%, a year earlier. The highest percentage of workless households was in north-east England. Some 23% of households including a working age adult were workless in the region. The lowest was in south-east England, where 13% of households were in this category. Workless households are defined as homes where no-one aged from 16 to 64 is in employment. This could be because they are looking for work, or they have chosen not to work, or they are unable to work. People may choose not to work because of family commitments, early retirement or study. They may be unable to work because of sickness or disability. The data shows that the number of workless households in the UK dropped by 182,000 over the year. This means that 4.9 million people aged 16 to 64 lived in workless households. The ONS said this was the first time the figure had dropped below five million since 2008. Some 14% of all children in the UK, or 1.6 million, were living in these households. About two-thirds of them were in single-parent households. Children's charities - Barnardo's and The Children's Society - said they welcomed the fact that the number of children living in workless households was falling. However, a move into work did not necessarily mean a move out of poverty, they argued. They said it was imperative for the government to reduce childcare costs for families on low incomes. The proportion of workless households was at its highest in 1996, when comparable records began, when it stood at 20.9% in the UK. This fell steadily to 17.3% in 2006 before rising to 19.2% in 2010. It has fallen relatively sharply in the past three years. In 2013, there were 297,000 households in which no adult has ever worked, down 43,000 on the previous year. If student households are excluded, this figure drops to 224,000. Mark Hoban, the Minister for Employment, said: \"Helping people off benefits and into work is one of this government's top priorities, so it is good news that the number of workless households has fallen by more than 425,000 since the coalition took office. \"By reforming the welfare system to ensure that people\n",

Mr Lewis said he was \"75% hopeful\" Mr Corbyn could lead Labour to victory at the next general election. And he said he was \"greatly\" annoyed by \"mischievous\" speculation about his leadership ambitions. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, the Norwich South MP - who quit the shadow cabinet last month rather than vote in favour of the government's Brexit bill - said it was \"flattering\" to be \"touted as a future leader\". It was \"possible\" that some figures close to Mr Corbyn could be behind the speculation, he said. Pressed on whether he wanted to ever lead Labour, he said: \"Never say never, I will say that. But at this moment in time we have a twice democratically elected leader, Jeremy Corbyn. \"I'm still supportive of Jeremy Corbyn. I will be doing all I can along with the rest of my colleagues in the Labour Party to varying degrees to make sure that he becomes the next prime minister of this country. \"There is no ifs, no buts. That's where I am.\" Asked how confident he was on a scale of one to 100 that Mr Corbyn could lead Labour to a general election victory in 2020, he replied: \"I would say I'm 75% hopeful it can happen. \"Given... the situation we find ourselves with Brexit - the chaotic situation - it's constantly moving. It would be a challenge for any leader I think.\" The Labour leadership came in for renewed criticism after the party lost the seat of Copeland to the Conservatives in last month's by-election. It was the first by-election gain by a governing party since 1982. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Corbyn would lead Labour into the 2020 general election. \"Of course we are building up a succession for the long term future and we have got some really great young talent coming through but they need more experience before eventually they will succeed,\" he added.

After the restart Duport scored in the corner as Catalans took a 10-8 lead. But Burgess put Wigan back ahead and further tries by Williams and Sam Tomkins followed by another Burgess effort saw Wigan home. The Warriors move up to seventh, four points clear of ninth-placed Warrington with two games remaining before the Super 8s. And they are now four points behind fourth-placed Hull - and the top four spot that would give them the chance to defend their title. Catalans are 10th, four points behind Huddersfield, who are eighth. A Wigan win or any sorts looked in doubt when Duport collected a last-tackle kick to go over, with Luke Walsh adding the two points to give the French side their two-point advantage. But Wigan, who were without coach Shaun Wane as he recovers after a hip operation, then dominated. A brilliant team try ended with Burgess going over in the corner and Williams skipped through to give them a 10-point lead. A Tony Gigot error then gifted Tomkins the away side's fourth try and the Burgess treble came when he went over from close range. Catalans head coach Steve McNamara: \"For 60 to 65 minutes, there was not a lot to choose between the two teams - in fact I think we were two tries to one up. \"It was really pleasing that we were in that contest but really disappointed with the last 15 minutes.

A medical helicopter sent to rescue casualties was forced to land and has yet to be recovered. Some 12,000 international soldiers are still deployed in Afghanistan to help local forces tackle the Taliban. Some of the foreign troops were sent to counter the recent militant insurgency in Helmand. Details of what happened in the incident, which took place near the town of Marjah on Tuesday, remain sketchy. US military spokesman Brig Gen Wilson Shoffner said one service member had died as a result of wounds, adding: \"We are deeply saddened by this loss... our heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of those involved.\" The identity of the casualties has not yet been revealed and no official details given on their service branch. A number of Afghan forces were also reported to have been wounded. The casualties occurred before the \"medevac\" helicopter was called in. Some reports said the helicopter, believed to be a UH-60 Black Hawk, had also come under fire. A US defence official said it had \"sustained damage while on the ground\" but had not been shot down. He said it remained on the ground and the military was working to recover it, but gave no further details. In 2011, 30 Americans were among 38 people killed in a Chinook helicopter crash in Wardak province. Helmand has long been a stronghold of the Taliban. Afghan forces, aided by the US military, have been engaged in a fierce conflict recently with Taliban fighters who seized large swathes of Sangin district.

            "Input: summarize: This comes after a public outcry following revelations in November that a neo-Nazi cell had apparently been able to go on a nationwide spree of racially motivated murders over several years, under the noses of the German intelligence services. The group of three are being held responsible for the deaths of eight Turkish and one Greek immigrant between 2000 and 2006, as well as a German policewoman in 2007. Yet the existence of the group, dubbed the Zwickau cell after the name of the town where they spent most of their time in hiding, only came to light in November when two of its members died in an apparent joint suicide or murder-suicide and the third handed herself in to the authorities. The NPD has been linked to the group, though the allegations have yet to be accepted in a court of law. The trio had made a DVD in which they boasted of the killings and said they had acted to serve the German nation and its people, describing themselves as the National Socialist Underground - echoing the national socialism (Nazism) of Hitler's Germany. The story of the killers has dominated headlines in Germany for months now and given rise to one of the biggest scandals in post-war Germany. It turns out intelligence agencies had had the group under surveillance for years, and even found a bomb-making factory in their garage back in 1998. So why were the trio not stopped earlier? Why were they allowed to disappear and then stay underground? And why was it that security services blamed the murders on the Turkish mafia at the time? A right-wing motive was never investigated. The failures have prompted some to ask whether there is more than incompetence to blame, whether Germany's police and security services contain elements sympathetic to the far right - an accusation the institutions vehemently deny. A parliamentary inquiry is currently under way into their activities, and Newsnight has seen a secret internal report revealing serious blunders by law enforcement agencies.

Turkey and the US both oppose Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but differ on how best to support the opposition. The visit has been overshadowed by the Turkish PM's remarks about Zionism. Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier this week called Zionism a \"crime against humanity\" - remarks that have been widely condemned, and which Mr Kerry on Friday called \"objectionable\". On the subject of Syria, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon said on Friday he was \"personally pained and distraught\" by the ongoing violence and suffering of civilians. He said there was a \"very small window of opportunity\" for the Syrian government and the opposition to hold talks, and admitted that, for the UN, there was \"not much political space\". Mr Ban went on to say that, in his opinion, the only thing for the moment was to increase humanitarian assistance but it was \"almost impossible\" for aid agencies to provide enough relief, as they were continually \"outpaced\" by the need. The crisis in Syria has been a central issue in John Kerry's first overseas trip as secretary of state, which is taking him to 11 countries in Europe and the Middle East. He said in Ankara that the US and Turkey \"both believe the first priority is to try and have a political solution. We would like to save lives, not see them caught up in a continuing war\". Mr Davutoglu said their main objective was to \"protect the innocent civilians of Syria\". In Rome on Thursday, Mr Kerry promised direct aid to Syrian rebels in the form of food and medical supplies, but not the weapons they say they need to win. Turkey has taken in more than 200,000 Syrian refugees and has been hit by deadly shelling across its 900km (560 mile) border with Syria.

There are also huge commercial responsibilities - how do we make money and save money? - and leadership and management duties. Leadership is about creating a moral vision for where you want to take a team; management is the daily activity of getting them there. It has always seemed to me that in rich newspapers, the editor gets to focus on editing, while other people think about the commercial and managerial side of it. For instance, the Daily Mail has several busy managing editors, whereas the Evening Standard has only one. George Osborne to become Standard editor Osborne Evening Standard job prompts call for inquiry George Osborne: From history buff to austerity editor Read more from Amol At organisations that are strapped for cash - and the Standard is facing big commercial challenges - editors have to spend relatively more of their time thinking about commercial and managerial obligations. And all of that is hugely time consuming. It leaves less time than you would like for the really exciting bit: editing. Editing is an exercise in selection and judgement: what to put in and - just as important - what to leave out. Which pictures, campaigns, and above all stories to run?

When making these decisions, based on your judgement, which is in turn informed by your values and experience, an editor has three sacred loyalties - in my view, in no particular order. First, to the truth; second, to the reader; and third, to the integrity and reputation of the newspaper. Some would argue that there are other loyalties. An editor of The Catholic Herald might think they had a duty to God, for instance; an editor of Country Life might feel they had a duty to England's enchanted land; and all editors are likely to feel a duty to those paying the bills. But those earlier loyalties are supreme. They are very different to the loyalties required by political parties.

This comes as Syria says it has approved the delivery of aid to 36 regions, including 11 besieged areas. Meanwhile, air strikes in and around the northern city of Aleppo have reportedly killed 31 civilians. They included 10 people on a bus going down a road used by rebels as a supply route, rescue workers from the Syrian Civil Defence force said. Stephen O'Brien, the UN aid chief, told the Security Council that consent from Damascus was needed to carry out the air operations, diplomats who were in the closed door meeting said. The formal request would be made on Sunday, they added. The UN has 19 areas designated as \"besieged\" in the country, where an estimated 600,000 people live. The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said it had already drawn up a plan to carry out air drops but that funding was also needed. However, a senior UN official warned that air operations were \"not imminent\". Earlier, a statement by the Syrian Mission to the UN said permissions for humanitarian aid included access to Kafr Batna, Saqba, Hammura, Jisrein, Zabadin, East Harasta, Zamalka, Madaya, Foua, Kefraya and Yarmouk. Eight other towns were approved to receive medical assistance, school supplies and milk for children, including Daraya and Douma, also under siege, it said. The Syrian opposition has warned the government may open the door just enough to alleviate international pressure before restricting access again. In February, the WFP carried out a 21-pallet air drop of aid to a government-held area of Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria, which ended in failure. Of the 21 pallets, 10 were unaccounted for, seven landed in no-man's land and four were damaged. But it has since carried out 44 air drops over the city, delivering mainly rice, chickpeas and beans to meet the immediate needs of around 100,000 residents.

But how ready is the nation to focus on \"the beautiful game\"? This was meant to be France's feel-good moment. But like cherries that are always hanging just out of reach, the build-up to Euro 2016 has been interrupted by one distraction after another: Having got through all of that, on the eve of the championship, France is facing fresh strikes at the national airline, and rubbish left to rot in the street as bin-men join the rolling protests over labour reforms. It's a wonder people have any time left to think about whether Didier Deschamps has got the right men in his defence line-up for the French national side. But it's not as if football has been entirely out of the headlines either. Last month, Eric Cantona implied that the French coach had allowed racism to colour his selection for the squad. That followed an earlier scandal that saw two of the country's top players embroiled in blackmail allegations - and consequently dropped from the Euro 2016 team.

But, just when it looked like it might turn out to be a first defeat of the season for the hosts, Brentford's debutant substitute Woods - who had only been on the pitch for two minutes - was easily dispossessed by Antenucci and the Italian, who had come on at half-time, fired home the equaliser into the corner with his left foot. The result means Leeds remain unbeaten this season, having drawn five of their six opening games in the Championship. Leeds manager Uwe Rosler: \"We lost our fearlessness and we made a mistake. When you do that against Brentford they can find the holes. \"Then we were down on confidence and they scored. We looked like we were afraid to get on the ball, that can happen. We deserved to trail at half-time. \"In the second half we started 0-0 and the substitutes helped us. The last 25-30 minutes we battered them in a football sense and could have won the game.

Mr Crompton's initial replacement, deputy Dawn Copley, stood down after her appointment was criticised. Mrs Copley had been investigated over her conduct with another force. As agreed with North Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Julia Mulligan, Mr Jones will remain in post until a permanent appointment is made, Ms Mulligan's South Yorkshire counterpart Dr Alan Billings said. \"I am confident that he will be able to move the force forward to a position where trust and confidence in the force can begin to be restored,\" said Dr Billings. David Crompton, who was due to retire in November after four years in the post, was suspended after what Dr Billings described as \"an erosion of trust and confidence in South Yorkshire Police\". Mr Crompton and the force have faced continuing criticism not only in relations to Hillsborough but also over its handling of investigations into child sexual exploitation. Mr Jones began his career in Greater Manchester and was Assistant Chief Constable for Police Service Northern Ireland until moving to North Yorkshire in 2013. He said he realised he was taking the post at a very difficult period and said he wanted to make a difference. \"First and foremost, I will engage with those communities both inside and outside of South Yorkshire who have been let down by the police service,\" Mr Jones said. \"I want to understand how their confidence in policing has been affected, and work with them to build it back up and restore pride back into the police service.\" He added he would be seeking support for a full review of South Yorkshire Police.

Staff at the Southern General hospital in Glasgow had failed to spot that Mrs Gibson had pre-eclampsia. A review of baby deaths at Crosshouse Hospital was announced on Tuesday. It came after a BBC Scotland investigation revealed that there had been six so-called \"unnecessary\" deaths of babies at the hospital since 2008. \"Unnecessary\" or \"avoidable\" deaths are referred to as those where harm was caused to a healthy baby during childbirth - usually resulting in them being deprived of oxygen. Reports into some of the deaths referred to failings in monitoring of the child's heartbeat during childbirth. Speaking in the Holyrood chamber, Mr Gibson urged Health Secretary Shona Robison to make the review \"wider and deeper\" so it could look at similar cases in other hospitals across the country. His wife has previously opened up in the House of Commons about the \"devastating\" effect of losing her baby. Mr Gibson said: \"On her due date in 2009, my wife Patricia, having been sent home and been physically sick, was finally admitted to the Southern General maternity unit despite their protests. \"A consultant junior doctor and two midwives examined her that day. Despite being 41, a first-time mother and in extreme pain from head to toe, no-one picked up her pre-eclampsia. She was given morphine and put to bed. \"Overnight our baby died and had to be delivered by caesarean. Patricia's liver ruptured and she spent 19 days in intensive care and high dependence.\" Mr Gibson said the couple had spent 20 months asking NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to explain how they would prevent such a failure of care reoccurring and impacting other lives.

Sentencing, Judge Alistair McCreath said he could find \"no real evidence\" that Gadd had atoned for his crimes. The 70-year-old showed no emotion as he left the dock at Southwark Crown Court. Judge McCreath told Gadd it was clear his victims \"were all profoundly affected\" by his abuse of them. \"You did all of them real and lasting damage and you did so for no other reason than to obtain sexual gratification for yourself of a wholly improper kind,\" he said. Judge McCreath said he assessed the seriousness of the offences by current guidelines, but he was limited to the maximum sentences that were available at the time the offences were committed, when \"the sentencing climate was less severe\". \"The offences for which I must pass sentence today took place many years ago at a time when in particular, in respect of one of them, the maximum sentence was considerably lower than that which is now available,\" he said. Judge McCreath said the modern equivalent offence of unlawful intercourse with a child under 13 would be equivalent to rape of a child, but said he was not permitted to pass a life sentence. He said the offence of attempted rape was \"so serious\" as to justify the maximum available sentence under the old regime of seven years, which he noted would be a lenient sentence under modern guidelines. Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC, defending, told the court that Gadd had been subject to a \"very high degree of vilification\" and \"demonification\" in the press after being jailed in Vietnam in 2006 for molesting two girls aged 11 and 12.

            "Input: summarize: Currently, they can be punished only if unsolicited calls cause \"substantial damage\" to householders. Ministers will also consult on imposing heftier fines. Some consumer groups say the measures do not go far enough. The Information Commissioner's Office received 120,310 complaints about \"unsolicited marketing calls\" from April-November 2013. It is illegal for companies to call domestic numbers registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS). The Telephone Preference Service runs a register that allows people to opt out of any unsolicited sales or marketing calls. Individuals can register free of charge by visiting the website. Or they can call 0845 070 0707. It takes 28 days for registration to become effective. Mobile phone numbers can also be registered, although this will not prevent unsolicited text messages. It is a legal requirement that all organisations - including charities, voluntary organisations and political parties - do not make such calls to numbers registered on the TPS unless they have the individual's consent to do so. Telephone Preference Service The rules do not apply when people consent to their details being used for marketing purposes. But BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said members of the public continued to get unwanted calls - often pre-recorded - despite being registered with the TPS. That was because not all companies were members of the Direct Marketing Association - the UK telemarketing industry body - some were overseas and some were \"good old-fashioned fraudsters\" out to steal money, he said. The problem of unwanted calls may never be fully eradicated, he added. Repeat offenders include firms inquiring about mis-sold payment protection insurance. Firms which flout the TPS rules can currently be fined up to £500,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office. Those which break media regulator Ofcom rules on silent and abandoned calls face fines of up to £2m. Critics say the system is not working because rules on enforcement are skewed in favour of rogue firms. Under Culture Secretary Maria Miller's plans, the current \"substantial damage\" threshold could be lowered. They would also make it simpler for regulators such as Ofcom, the Insolvency Service and the Information Commissioner's Office to swap data about who the offenders might be. And the Ministry of Justice will launch a consultation on Monday\n",

FBI assistant director Ronald Hosko said the Operation Cross Country VII raids had been the agency's largest action against child exploitation. The FBI said 2,700 children have been rescued in such US raids since 2003. The victims in the most recent raids were almost all girls and range in age from 13 to 17. They had been prostituted in a variety of locations, including truck stops, casinos, motels as well as on social media and online advertisements. Mr Hosko said the accused had preyed on vulnerable teenagers, exploiting them over a period of time. \"Girls are enticed with compliments or offers, [asked] do they want to make some money,\" he said. \"Then they are trapped into this cycle that involves drugs, that involves physical abuse. It may involve torture.\" Since 2003, some 1,350 people have been convicted in such cases, including life prison sentences for 10 pimps, the FBI said. Assets of more than $3.1m (£2m) have been seized. The US justice department has estimated as many as 450,000 children run away from home each year. It says a third of teens living on the street will be lured toward prostitution within 48 hours of leaving home. Some lawmakers have said further legal protections are needed. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden has introduced a bill to require local police, as well as foster care and child welfare programmes to identify children lured into sex trafficking as victims of abuse and neglect, making them eligible for protection and services. \"In much of the country today if a girl is found in the custody of a so-called pimp she is not considered to be a victim of abuse, and that's just wrong and defies common sense,\" Sen Wyden said during a hearing last month.\n",

Kevin McShane of the Institute of Civil Engineers told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme that it was a surprise \"nothing more serious\" had happened because the foundations had moved. \"We can see at the base of the columns that the wall and the beams have moved,\" he said. \"That's caused stress throughout the structure, given the shape of the structure it's very top heavy, it's leaning on one side towards the pitch. \"So if there's some problems with the foundation, the natural reaction of the whole structure is to try to topple over onto the pitch.\" On Wednesday, the IFA's chief executive Patrick Nelson said staging the international at Windsor Park remained its \"only focus\".

It is unlikely that this will be the last time a law enforcement agency tries to compel a tech company to help bypass security measures. It had been reported that there were about a dozen other cases in which the US Justice Department was pursuing court orders to force Apple to help its investigators. The highest profile of these was in Brooklyn, New York, where the FBI wanted access to an iPhone belonging to a defendant who had already pleaded guilty to drug dealing. In that case, a federal judge had rejected the DoJ's effort to invoke the All Writs Act - a three-centuries-old statute that allows court orders to be issued in circumstances where other laws don't apply. The DoJ had launched an appeal, but it is not yet clear if it will continue or drop it. Its decision may be based on whether the technique used to extract data from Farook's handset can be used in other cases. The New York case involved an iPhone 5S running the iOS 7 operating system, while the San Bernardino, California case was about an iPhone 5C running the more modern iOS 9. What works against one device might not work against the other. But assuming the US government will at some point try again to use the All Writs Act to force Apple or some other tech company to circumvent its data protection measures, it may take a Supreme Court ruling to determine whether this is truly within the authorities' power. At this point, there is nothing to compel the FBI to reveal how it was done, although Apple is likely to be pressing hard to find out. The tech firm's lawyers have already said they would want details of the technique to be made public if evidence from the cracked iPhone is later used at trial. But it could remain secret. There is scope within US law for the authorities to withhold the source of information if it was supplied to them on a confidential basis, and to protect sensitive intelligence-gathering methodologies. Not necessarily. The court order originally obtained by the FBI had instructed Apple to come up with a special version of its operating system that would have prevented Farook's iPhone from deleting its data or imposing long lockout periods if too many incorrect passcode guesses\n",

Ocado chief executive Tim Steiner said it had achieved \"robust trading\" in a challenging environment. However, the average order size fell 2.7% to £108.10 against the backdrop of continuing supermarket price wars. The rise of German competitors Aldi and Lidl has shaken up the sector, putting pressure on the big four supermarkets, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons. But investors welcomed Ocado's latest results, sending its share price up by more than 7% to 262p in morning trading. Annual revenues rose 14.8% to £1.27bn, and the retailer's customer base grew by almost 14% over the year to 580,000. However, Ocado said it was still in continued talks with several international retailers in regards to a partnership using the Ocado Smart Platform. When it released its full-year results in February last year, Ocado said it was in \"advanced discussions with multiple potential international partners\" for the platform, adding it expected to sign \"multiple deals\" in the medium term. Analysts believe agreements with retailers in the US and western Europe are important in driving Ocado's share price. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: \"The group has long said it's making progress on deals with third parties, but there hasn't been much in the way of tangible progress recently. \"The appointment of Luke Jensen [from Sainsbury's] as head of Ocado's Smart Platform will raise hopes that the group can finally get someone to sign on the dotted line.\" However, Mr Salmon warned that \"following Amazon's entry into the market, competitive pressures are rising in its core business\". \"In this context, it's arguably more important than ever for the group to get something over the line.\" Last year, Morrisons agreed to supply groceries to Amazon customers in the UK under a new deal with the US online giant.

Eben Etzebeth was shown a yellow card for the visitors just after the restart then Bernard Foley scored a crucial try to seal a morale-boosting win. Earlier on Saturday, New Zealand beat Argentina to stay top of the table. The Wallabies, who stay bottom, eventually opened their account in this year's championship after back-to-back defeats by the All Blacks. They have had their troubles since losing the World Cup Final to New Zealand at Twickenham in October. A 3-0 series defeat to England and those defeats to New Zealand had put pressure on coach Michael Cheika. Many Wallabies fans voted with their feet and the Suncorp Stadium was half empty as the Springboks heaped on further misery in the opening minutes. Whiteley barged over for his third international try, then Goosen dived over after Adriaan Strauss intercepted a Quade Cooper punt. There were boos around the stadium with the Wallabies trailing 14-3, but they were soon silenced as a high pass from Will Genia picked out Coleman who went over in the corner. The home side carried the momentum into the second-half and Foley gave them the lead for the first time with a penalty after Etzebeth was sin-binned for a challenge. Samu Kerevi thought he had gone over in the corner for the Wallabies but his knee was adjudged to have been in touch before he grounded the ball. The Wallabies were now under the cosh and Foley gave the home side some breathing space when he dived over after a dummy pass.

There's a picture of a smiling young mother and her child from Somalia on the beach at Brighton. Most images though are menacing and hostile, reflecting the UK and the Midlands' often contradictory response to migrants. Some show National Front marches in the 1970s and a landlady's window notice saying in stark terms: \"No coloureds\". \"What we wanted to do was to challenge people,\" curator Sarah Plumb told me. \"It's about asking them to question some of their negative stereotypes that are presented around migrants, often in the mainstream media.\" Screened on the staircase is the 1968 Birmingham speech of Enoch Powell. His anti-immigration \"Rivers of Blood\" warning to West Midlands Conservatives still casts a long political shadow. Prof Martin Halliwell, deputy pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Leicester, has been building links with university colleagues in Gujarat in west India. But UK political sensitivities over migrants is clouding attempts at deeper exchanges. \"The government's tightening of visas for migrants from Eastern Europe has affected us dramatically and detrimentally, especially in South Asia,\" he said. \"We are seeing a drying up of the flow of students, which is vital for the life of our universities.\" On Leicester's Hinckley Road, the Polish delis reflect the arrival of new migrants. In excess of 45,000 migrants have settled in the East Midlands since 2011 alone. That's the estimate in findings compiled for the BBC by researchers at Oxford University. According to new figures from the Office of National Statistics, net annual migration to the UK last year was under 300,000, with the largest group coming from Poland. The East Midlands parliamentary constituencies with the biggest migrants are Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire, with 9,500, and Nottingham East with just over 8,000.

Up to 30% of plastic released into the oceans each year comes from primary microplastics, not the disintegration of larger pieces, a report found. Debris from tyre abrasion and synthetic fabrics are the main sources, they say. The IUCN reviewed data from seven global regions to look at how much of the estimated 9.5 million tonnes of new plastic waste released into the oceans each year comes from primary microplastics. These are tiny plastic particles from the likes of consumer products rather than the degradation of larger bits of plastic in the oceans. The report found between 15% and 31% of plastic pollution came from primary microplastics, of which the biggest contributors (almost two-thirds) were abrasion of synthetic textiles, while washing, and abrasion of tyres, while driving. Synthetic rubber, made from a variant of plastic, makes up around 60% of the rubber used in tyres. Other sources included microbeads in cosmetics, which contributed about 2% of the releases to the ocean globally. Franois Simard, deputy director of IUCN's marine programme, said the findings came as a surprise. \"We discovered that most of the microplastics are coming from either the clothes or from the tyres,\" he told BBC News. \"Microplastics are going everywhere in the sea and into the food chain, let's close the plastic tap.\" IUCN director general Inger Andersen said the report was \"a real eye-opener\". \"Our daily activities, such as washing clothes and driving, significantly contribute to the pollution choking our oceans, with potentially disastrous effects on the rich diversity of life within them, and on human health,\" she said. The release of microbeads from cosmetic products has received widespread publicity, resulting in action from manufacturers. However, solving plastic pollution from tyres and synthetic clothes will be harder to address. Joao de Sousa, marine project manager for the IUCN's global marine programme, said solutions must include product and infrastructure design as well as consumer behaviour. For example, synthetic clothes could be designed\n",

The 53-year-old, who was from Glasgow, was released from prison in September 2014 but was sought by police in April for breaching the terms of his licence. Police described him at the time as \"potentially dangerous\". His death was being treated as unexplained. Hamilton was nicknamed the Blackhill Butcher, after the Glasgow housing estate from which he operated. He had been on the police's most-wanted list before he was jailed in 2000 over a string of charges including drug dealing, torture, abduction and sodomy. Hamilton was sentenced to a minimum of nine years in prison after being found guilty at the High Court in Inverness. The case was moved 200 miles from Glasgow amid fears that witnesses could be intimidated. Hamilton had evaded justice on 12 previous occasions when witnesses were too terrified to testify. In court, a sickening picture emerged of how Hamilton, also known as the Fat Controller, entrapped young men with offers of drugs. Two young drug addicts were imprisoned in a Glasgow flat, stabbed through the cheek and had boiling water poured over them. Another attack in Edinburgh included an attempt to cut off a victim's finger. Passing sentence, judge Lord Kingarth said: \"You showed yourself capable of taking sadistic pleasure in the infliction of pain and the inspiration of real terror over long periods. You pose a substantial danger to the public.\" When Police Scotland issued an appeal to find Hamilton in April they said he may be dangerous and urged members of the public not to approach him. A further appeal was made in June. In October, an appeal was made on the BBC's Crimewatch programme and the Crimestoppers charity also offered a reward of £2,000 for information leading to his arrest. Det Supt Kenny Graham said the site near West Calder where the remains were found would stay closed off or several more days \"whilst we complete further searches and specialists carry out their work\". The nearby B7105 will also remain closed.

Ms Hawkins, a shoe machinist, helped lead the Suffragette campaign in Leicester and gave speeches in London. Her grandson said the statue would be in recognition of all the women who fought for universal suffrage. The anonymous donor had originally pledged some of the funds needed for the artwork but was moved to donate the full amount after watching the film Suffragette. Ms Hawkins' grandson, Peter Barratt, said the donor had \"made dreams and ambitions come true\". \"The statue will feature Alice but it is in recognition of all the women in the Leicester Suffragette movement 100 years ago, to gain a basic human right that that we all have today.\" Ms Hawkins left school in Stafford in 1876 to start work as a shoe machinist, later joining Equity Shoes, which encouraged workers to take part in political activism. From there she joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and was one of 18 women to be jailed when they were charged by mounted police in Hyde Park in February 1907. After her time in prison, she organised meetings and protests in Leicester, inviting Sylvia Pankhurst and helping form the city's section of the WSPU. She died in 1946, aged 83, and was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave. Mr Barratt said he was now inviting ideas from artists for the statue and hoped it would be put up in about 18 months' time.\n",

However, a National Audit Office report warned it must first find £5.8bn in new savings to meet the extra commitments. Defence minister Harriett Baldwin said it was delivering an affordable plan. The government set out its Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) in November 2015, announcing £12bn in extra defence spending. The review included plans for nine Boeing P8 maritime patrol aircraft - to replace the RAF's scrapped Nimrod jets - and that the purchase of 24 new F35 fighter aircraft would be accelerated. The NAO report said additional planned expenditure amounted to £24.4bn of new commitments to the MoD budget. The projected cost of funding the plan increased to £178bn - a rise of 7% - it said. 4,500 miles (7,200 km) maximum range without refuelling 490 knots (910km/h; 560mph) maximum speed 28 P-8A Poseidon aircraft in use by the United States 2 other countries, India and Australia, have variants of the aircraft in use or on order The review said the MoD was already having to use a £10bn contingency fund set aside for emergencies and will have to find another £5.8bn in savings over the next 10 years. The report warned the MoD had yet to generate £2.5bn of the £7.1bn savings already factored into the plan. However, head of the NAO, Sir Amyas Morse, said the affordability of the equipment plan \"is at greater risk than at any time since its inception\". \"It is worrying to see that the costs of the new commitments arising from the review considerably exceed the net increase in funding for the plan. \"There is little room for unplanned cost growth and the MoD must actively guard against the risk of a return to previous practice where affordability could only be maintained by delaying or reducing the scope of projects.\" The spending plans have also been hit by recent currency fluctuations as the MoD looks to buy new equipment from the US.

It was also down in its third-biggest market, Spain. However, its second-biggest market, Brazil, saw a \"strong performance\", with an increase in both profit and net interest income. The group's net interest income - the money it made on lending, measured by the difference between the interest it gets from borrowers and what it pays savers - fell by 2.3% to €7.79bn. \"While the low-interest-rate environment within developed economies remains a challenge for parts of our business, the resilience of our business model has allowed us to continue to deliver, with our Latin American and consumer finance franchises growing particularly well throughout the year.,\" said the group's executive chairman, Ana Botin. However, she added: \"We expect to end 2016 exceeding last year's profit, enabling us to increase our dividend per share and earnings per share.\" In its UK management statement, the bank said it expected the country's decision to leave the EU to result in the near term in \"lower consumer confidence and, over time, lower economic growth\". \"In addition, the lower value of sterling, when combined with an ongoing increase in oil prices, is likely to lead to higher inflation,\" it added. Nathan Bostock, UK chief executive, added: \"Although we have not seen a material impact on our business in the short period since the EU referendum, we do expect a more challenging macroeconomic environment ahead.\" The additional £30m provision for PPI mis-selling in the third quarter means that in the first nine months of this year, Santander has set aside £397m for compensation and related costs. It said the provision \"represents our best estimate of future PPI-related claims costs, including the impact of the delayed two-year time bar\".

His boss, the owner of a delivery firm, was found beheaded alongside flags with Arabic inscriptions. President Francois Hollande has held a security meeting with ministers. Prime Minister Manuel Valls cut short his visit to South America to return to France which is on its highest state of alert after the attack in the small town of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier some 40km (25 miles) from Lyon. Officials and residents of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier gathered outside the town hall on Saturday morning to observe a minute's silence. Mr Salhi was arrested at the Air Products factory on Friday morning. Later, anti-terror police searched the apartment of Mr Salhi, a father-of-three, in the Moines neighbourhood of the town. They took his wife and sister into custody. Another man was arrested but released without charge. Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office, has said police have so far not found any motive or possible foreign connection, and that Mr Salhi is not speaking to investigators. Under French anti-terrorism laws, suspects can be held for up to four days before either being released or charged. Yassin Salhi had been investigated in the past about his alleged links with Islamist militants. It is alleged he was waved through the gates of the factory because he was a regular delivery driver. Police and firefighters later found a half-destroyed car which had been rammed into canisters containing chemicals and a man trying to ignite more. Mr Salhi's boss, a 54-year-old man whose name has not been released by police, was found beheaded at the scene. His head had been placed on the factory railings. It is not clear when he died. Speaking after the attack, President Hollande said: \"We have no doubt that the attack was to blow up the building. It bears the hallmarks of a terrorist attack.\" He said the attack would remind people of the attacks in and around Paris in January that killed 17 people. \"We all remember what happened before in our country.

            "Input: summarize: It had been thought that being unhappy was bad for health - particularly for the heart. But the decade-long analysis, published in the Lancet, said previous studies had just confused cause and effect. However, experts argued that unhappiness in childhood may still have a lasting impact. A series of studies had shown that how happy people are, strongly predicts how long they are going to live. Ideas included detrimental changes in stress hormones or the immune system resulting in a higher risk of death. But the research team in the UK and Australia said those studies failed to deal with reverse causality - namely, that people who are ill are not very happy. Participants in the Million Women Study were asked to regularly rate their health, happiness and levels of stress. The results showed that whether people were \"never\", \"usually\" or \"mostly\" happy had no impact on their odds of dying during the duration of the study once other factors such as health or whether they smoked were taken into account. Dr Bette Liu, one of the researchers at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: \"Illness makes you unhappy, but unhappiness itself doesn't make you ill. \"We found no direct effect of unhappiness or stress on mortality, even in a 10-year study of a million women.\" Co-author Prof Sir Richard Peto, from the University of Oxford, said light smokers had double the risk of an early death and regular smokers had three times the risk of dying during the study period, but that happiness was \"irrelevant\". He said it could have indirect effects if people started consuming large amounts of alcohol or massively overeating, but happiness itself \"does not have any material, direct, effect on mortality\". But he warned the myth may be too entrenched to shake off: \"People will still believe stress causes heart attacks after this story has been and gone. \"It isn't true, but it suits people to believe it.\" In a commentary, Dr Philipe de Souto Barreto and professor Yves Rolland from the University Hospital of Toulouse in France, said: \"Further research from a lifecourse perspective is needed since happiness during critical periods, such as childhood, could have important consequences on health in adulthood.\"\n",

F1 race director Charlie Whiting said the main reason for the delay was to give more time for drivers to assess its impact.

The company's decision to launch these TV apps - which we've been expecting for some time now - is the first significant step the company has made to build its challenge to the likes of Netflix and Hulu. To do that, though, it will need to offer programmes that are of a far higher quality than what is on Facebook right now. That will require big investment in getting top talent to make Facebook-only video. One interesting move will be how it plans to make money from TV.

Thanks to his form with the Exiles, a nickname earned rather than chosen after years spent out of the city as a reformed club without a home, Flynn impressed as a midfielder with an eye for goal. In the non-league pyramid at least, this postman did always deliver. A switch to full time football was the dream, achieved with a transfer to Barry Town, a move that changed the course of Flynn's life. There was to be no future in shelf stacking or letter delivering for Flynn after joining the full time Welsh Premier League side, as he went on to make over 400 Football League appearances for the likes of Gillingham, Wigan and Bradford City. He returned to his first club and first love Newport County five years ago, helping to steer them to a promotion 25 years in the making. Flynn was 'heartbroken' when the club released him as Terry Butcher axed 11 players, after Newport's millionaire chairman Les Scadding opted to walk away from the club. He soon returned when the Supporters' Trust succeeded Scadding, working in various roles including as a club ambassador, in marketing, and as a first team coach. He even found time to get in a few games for Welsh League third-tier side Undy, so it was no surprise this season when Flynn came out of retirement to help the beleaguered Exiles. Flynn's career at County, and in football, was almost over before it started. \"I got kicked out of the youth team. The youth team manager Glyn Jones asked me what I had done at the weekend and I said I had played for Pill. He said 'I know, I saw in the\n",

Builders also hired more workers and ordered more supplies to deal with an increase in new projects. Economists said the sector was recovering after a slow start to 2017. \"A sustained rebound in residential building provides an encouraging sign that the recent a soft patch for property values has not deterred new housing supply,\" said Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit. \"Instead, strong labour market conditions, resilient demand and ultra-low mortgage rates appear to have helped boost work on residential development projects.\" The data contrasts with reports earlier this week suggesting greater caution by homebuyers and lenders. Building society Nationwide said house prices had fallen for a third consecutive in May - the longest run of decline since 2009, just after the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the Bank of England said loan approvals fell to a seven-month low in April. The latest Markit/CIPS construction reading was still much weaker than the post-crisis high of 64.6 seen in January 2014. However, the survey found there had been solid rises across the whole sector in May, including in civil engineering and commercial building. Input prices for construction firms also rose at the slowest pace for seven months, despite the prolonged weakness of the pound. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result suggested the Brexit vote's \"dampening influence on construction activity is fading\". But he added: \"Note, however, that the PMI has had to exceed 53 in the past to signal growth. \"May's PMI reading, therefore, is consistent with quarter-on-quarter growth in construction output of only about 0.5%.\"\n",

The details emerged as John was struck off by a panel, which heard one of his victims felt \"degraded and scared\". Essex Police said John was still wanted by officers. John, then a doctor at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, took covert videos of women, without their knowledge, at The Harvey Centre in April 2011. It is understood he used a bag containing a concealed camera. One victim told police: \"The incident has made me feel dirty and degraded. I feel like I can't wear a skirt anymore and I am going to be scared every time I see a man with a bag. \"I feel violated as if he has actually touched me inappropriately. At this moment in time I am very upset and shocked.\" Chelmsford magistrates released John on bail to be sentenced in May 2011, by which time he had already left the UK. The panel heard he then phoned his colleague Jeffrey Philips, a consultant in intensive care. \"He understood that Dr John had flown out on the day of the Royal wedding, which took place on 29 April 2011, in the belief that the airport would be quiet,\" the panel heard. Police broke down the door of his rented flat in Dads Wood, Harlow, a week later and found food in the fridge that was weeks out of date. Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service said it had served notice about its hearing to John's parents in India. In reaching its decision, the panel said: \"Public confidence in the medical profession would be seriously undermined if Dr John was not erased from the medical register after indicating a guilty plea to an offence related to his actions in filming beneath women's skirts, and then fleeing the country prior to sentencing. It added: \"Ms A [the victim] had been caused significant and understandable distress. \"In addition, it considered that the public would also regard Dr John's action in absconding before sentencing to be wholly reprehensible and unbecoming of a doctor.

A spokesperson for St George Hospital confirmed that a 21-year-old man was treated for a redback bite. The redback spider, closely related to the black widow spider, is distinguished by a long red stripe on its abdomen. The spider's bite causes severe pain, sweating and nausea. The BBC spoke to the owners of the property who confirmed that the man had been bitten on the penis as described in media reports. He was later discharged from hospital in a stable condition. Although there are recorded cases of deaths from redback bites, none have occurred since the development of antivenom in 1956.\n",

She handed over to her husband, Lt Col Alan Wilkinson, last month. The exchange makes the pair, who married in 1998, the highest ranking couple to follow each other in a command role. Gill, 45, originally from Northern Ireland, was in the Army from the mid-90s but left when her two children were born. She re-enlisted in the Army reserve in 2003 and took command of the regiment in 2014. Husband Alan, 46, who was also in the Army before joining the Army Reserve, took on the role of main carer for their children when Gill became CO (commanding officer). Gill told BBC Scotland: \"It almost feels like I handed over the children to him two-and-a-half years before taking command and this feels very similar. \"You do feel a responsibility for a regiment. It is quite a parental role. Your soldiers are like your family. \"Normally when a commanding officer leaves command they don't look back at the regiment, they leave the next CO to carry on. \"Obviously I'm trying to do that but I can keep an eye out and ask how people are getting on and satisfy that parental bit.\" Alan, originally from the Borders, met Gill at Dundee University before joining the Army. He joined the reserves in 2009. Alan said taking over from his wife was no different to any new job. He said: \"We have worked closely together throughout our career in the Army. I was in the fortunate position of being able to speak to Gill in the months before about it so it only took about four days to handover. It was fine.\" Gill, who will now work with the Army Reserve part-time, said opportunities for women were \"getting wider\". She said: \"When I joined the Royal Logistic Corps it was because it offered, as far as I was concerned, the greatest opportunity to do the same job as men were doing. \"It is still majority male but the regiment I was commanding was about a quarter to a third female.\" \"I think ever since I joined the Army it has been increasing with more and more opportunities opening up. \"But we are really at the final bastion now where women are moving into combat roles.\" Alan says his wife\n",

It said failure to do this would have a severe impact on migrants' rights. Ministers say they expect this to happen but need equivalent guarantees for UK citizens on the Continent. The question of what will happen to the estimated 2.9 million citizens of other EU countries who have made their home in the UK in recent years is one of the most controversial arising from the UK's vote to leave the EU in June's referendum. The government has said it expects an early resolution of the issue once official talks on the terms of the UK's separation from the EU begin next spring. But it has refrained from giving any guarantees on their future status - saying this is impossible without similar safeguards for the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in Spain, France, Italy and other EU countries. But the Lords EU Justice sub-committee said the UK should not wait to hear from other EU countries and that making a binding commitment now was \"morally the right thing to do\". If this was not possible before Article 50 is triggered, expected before the end of March, the peers said the issue should be negotiated separately from other matters to ensure a \"preliminary\" agreement as quickly as possible. Without any agreement, it said EU nationals living in the UK would be subject to \"Byzantine\" national immigration laws and many would be unable to meet the criteria for permanent residency despite having been here for more than five years. \"The government is under a moral obligation to give a unilateral declaration immediately to safeguard the EU citizenship rights of all EU nationals in the UK when the UK withdraws from the EU,\" said Baroness Kennedy QC, the Labour peer who chairs the cross-party committee. \"I also believe that such a gesture will stimulate reciprocal commitments from the other EU countries where UK citizens are currently living. \"For the last six months, the lives of EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU have been shrouded in anxiety. \"Their rights to live, work and reside in their country of choice are now so unclear that people have no idea how, or even where, they should plan their futures.\" The government has said it wants to limit the currently unconditional right of EU citizens\n",

Sales also rose 20% to $23.2bn in the second quarter to the end of June, boosted by strong growth in the US. Its shares, which fell 1.3% during the day, leapt 18.5% to $571.24 a share in after-hours trading on Wall Street. The firm was also upbeat on its prospects for the current third quarter, forecasting sales would grow between 13% and 24% compared to last year, much higher than analysts had predicted. Sales in North America rose 25.5% to $13.8bn in the second quarter, driven by purchases of electronic goods and general merchandise, helping to drive the strong performance. Its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, also made a contribution, with sales up 81% compared to the same quarter last year. It said its widely promoted \"Prime Day\" on 15th July - which offered special deals to customers who signed up to its fast delivery service - had been a success with more new members trying it globally than any other day in the firm's history. Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos credited hard work for the results: \"The teams at Amazon have been working hard for customers,\" he said. Throughout its history, Amazon's revenue has climbed while its profit has hovered around or below zero. On Thursday evening, the e-commerce company reported a profit. As customers in North America bought electronics and others products, sales in its biggest market rose more than 25% compared to last year. And if you thought Microsoft's cloud computing business did well, then take a look at Amazon web services which includes its cloud business - revenue soared more than 80 percent. The only slight negative was that sales growth outside the US wasn't nearly as impressive.

Chris Fraser, of Sirius, said its case stood \"up to scrutiny\" and it was determined to pursue the plan. The North York Moors National Park Authority is to consider a planning application on 30 June. The 229-page report by the park authority does not make any recommendation about the proposed mine. It acknowledged that there were likely to be economic benefits but said the proposal did not represent \"exceptional circumstances\". The report said the National Park Authority's statutory responsibility was to \"conserve and enhance the North York Moors for the enjoyment of present and future generations\". Sirius said it believed exceptional circumstances had been demonstrated and the mining was in the public interest, with environmental effects \"mitigated\". The term \"potash\" is used to describe a range of minerals containing potassium, and the proposal is to mine polyhalite. The mine would transform North Yorkshire's economy, Ryedale District Council and Scarborough Borough Council has claimed. However a report published earlier this month suggested that the five-year construction phase of the mine would cost the area's tourism industry £10m a year. The Campaign for National Parks said it hoped the authority would reject the planning application. The decision was an \"important test of the protection afforded national parks\" and there were strong planning grounds for turning it down, it added. Plans include a construction of a minehead at Dove's Nest Farm and Haxby Plantation about 1.6 miles (2.5km) from the village of Sneaton involving mining shafts, buildings, roads and a helicopter landing site on a 64-hectare site.\n",

Smoke could be seen billowing from shops on the outskirts of the market on Thursday, as dozens of fire engines tackled the flames. The fire was out by Thursday night and there were no reports of injuries. Tsukiji's interior industrial market - where the famous tuna auctions take place - was undamaged and the area was open to tourists as usual. The blaze broke out at about 16:50 local time (07:50 GMT), Japanese broadcaster NHK said, in the outer region of the market and close to the surrounding area's narrow streets. The area is home to many sushi restaurants and shops, some of which have been evacuated, NHK reports. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The blaze seems to have affected several old wooden buildings. The market was constructed in 1935, in the aftermath of the great Kanto earthquake of 1923, and built largely from corrugated iron sheds. Today, it is a sprawling, busy market, but is seen by many as rundown and overcrowded. Nonetheless, its enormous volume and variety of produce means it receives tens of thousands of tourist visitors each year. The market is due to be moved by the end of 2017. Efforts to move the market to a more modern location have been met with resistance by many of the workers, some of whom have been in the family business for generations.

It comes two years after a parliamentary commission proposed a shake-up of the UK banking industry in the wake of the financial crisis. The regime will take effect from March. The new rules follow a public outcry after a series of scandals in the industry, including Libor rigging and foreign exchange rate fixing. The Chancellor George Osborne said in his annual Mansion House speech last month: \"The public rightly asks why it is that after so many scandals, and such cost to the country, so few individuals have faced punishment in the courts.\" The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said at the same event that the \"age of irresponsibility\" was over as he set out new plans for jail terms for rogue bankers and traders who manipulate markets to be lengthened from seven to 10 years. Earlier today, the former UBS and Citigroup trader Tom Hayes, who is accused of manipulating the Libor rate, told a court at his trial that senior managers knew what he was doing. \"I acted with complete transparency... My managers knew, my manager's manager knew. In some cases the CEO [chief executive] was aware of it,\" he said. Mr Hayes is the first person to be prosecuted over the Libor scandal which cost Barclays Bank a then record £290m in 2012 before Royal Bank of Scotland £390m for its part in the scandal. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) - part of the Bank of England - said their new rules would place the \"burden of proof\" on top banking executives in incidents of wrongdoing within their companies. The rules replace existing arrangements that require regulators to prove senior executives were responsible for wrongdoing. FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley said: \"Today we have given clarity on rules that will embed personal accountability into the culture of the City. New conduct rules will add further momentum to improving standards across the industry.\" The PRA's rule book sets out a list of key individuals to be held to account including chief executives, finance directors, chairmen and senior non-independent directors.

Colin Ackermann hit a six off the final ball as Leicestershire edged out Lancashire in a thrilling finish. Surrey beat Somerset despite a 12-run over-rate penalty and there were also wins for holders Northants and Kent. A total of 66 sixes were struck in Sunday's five games, 19 of them in the Sussex v Glamorgan game. While South Africa's Test team crashed to a 211-run defeat against England at Lord's, it was a good day for some of their compatriots on the county circuit - especially those playing for Glamorgan. Chief among them was Ingram, who hit seven sixes to rescue his side from 7-2. He added 130 with former Proteas batsman Jacques Rudolph (49) and then 70 off the final six overs with Johannesburg-born Chris Cooke (37 not out) as they posted 198-3. When it was Glamorgan's turn to field, Ingram weighed in with the wickets of Ross Taylor and Ben Brown. And although Wright equalled Ingram's sixes tally in his 101 off 53 balls, he fell to another South African, Marchant de Lange, in the penultimate over as they came up short on 180-6. At Aigburth, Liam Livingstone (48 off 34 balls) and Jos Buttler (39 off 21) were the main contributors to Lancashire Lightning's 173-9. Leicestershire looked comfortable needing only six off the final over, but Mathew Pillans was run out after four singles to start the over. Ackermann was on strike for the final ball from Kyle Jarvis and managed to clear the rope at deep extra cover to finish with an unbeaten 62 off 41 balls as they won by three wickets. \"In T20 cricket you have to come in with good intent, to hit the ball and to run hard,\" he told BBC Radio Leicester.

She received the award from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott at a ceremony at Parliament House, Canberra. The award winners are selected from public nominations and announced ahead of Australia Day, on 26 January. The 2015 Young Australian of the Year is 21-year-old West Australian Drisana Levitzke-Gray, a young deaf woman who advocates for other deaf people. Senior Australian of the Year is 61-year-old Jackie French from New South Wales, a children's author and advocate for children with learning difficulties, and the Australian Local Hero is 41-year-old Juliette Wright from Queensland, who established an online platform to get goods and services to vulnerable and marginalised people. This year was the first time in the 55-year history of the awards that women have secured the top honour in all four categories. The recipients were great Australians and great role models, said chairman of the National Australia Day Council, Ben Roberts-Smith. \"It is a great moment in the 55-year history of these awards to honour four women. \"Rosie, Jackie, Drisana and Juliette remind us of the many ways in which women contribute to our nation; that women are a force for change, a voice for rights, influencers, educators and the heart of our communities,\" he said. After her son's death, UK-born Ms Batty emerged as an articulate and powerful advocate for the rights of women and children living in violent relationships, giving new force to efforts to prevent family violence across Australia. Family violence activists say Ms Batty's ability to explain to the public why so many women struggle to protect their children from violent partners helped make the issue of family violence a key campaign issue for all political parties in last November's Victoria state election. Greg Anderson, 54, killed Luke Batty in front of shocked onlookers at a cricket oval in Tyabb.

Loans held by his property companies were sold to Cerberus, the US investment fund, as part of that deal. Mr Graham said he has tapes of \"thousands\" of phone calls made by Frank Cushnahan, a businessman who worked with him and was later a Nama advisor. The tapes were made between 2005 and 2008 when Mr Cushnahan worked with the Graham family's bookmaking business. The committee was told the tapes would be made available to law enforcement agencies. Phonecalls in and out of the Grahams' business were recorded for regulatory reasons. The business relationship between the Grahams and Mr Cushnahan broke down in 2008. Mr Graham claimed Mr Cushnahan was then \"intent on destroying our businesses\". Mr Cushnahan has previously issued a statement to the media denying any wrongdoing. Mr Graham added that he has already spoken to the National Crime Agency and made a complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Mr Cushnahan has previously said he did give up the property firm interests and that it was due to an \"administrative error\" that he was still listed as a shareholder.

Typhoo Tea produces 125 million tea bags a week at its factory in Moreton, Wirral, which have just one ingredient - tea leaves, and they are imported. Black tea is a global commodity, traded in dollars. Following the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote, costs have soared for this renowned brand as 95% of its sales are in the UK. \"This is an absolute disaster for a company the size of ours,\" says Mr Saha. \"The very sharp fall in the pound means the impact is at least a quarter of a million pounds a month for us. This is having a very negative impact on our business and we are really suffering. It's now come to a point where it's not sustainable for us.\" The news comes amid warnings of rising prices in the grocery sector, and with supermarket chain Morrisons increasing the cost of a jar of Marmite by 12.5%. There are plenty of winners from the fall in the value of sterling. But Typhoo Tea is a graphic illustration of what it's like for a business with one raw imported material. Typhoo has been trading for more than a century. These days, most of its black tea comes from Kenya. It's then blended and packaged on site. The company also packages own-label tea for most of the major supermarkets. In addition, it produces a range of herbal teas and those ingredients are sourced in euros. It's a high-volume, low-margin business. The cost of the ingredient depends on the quality of the leaf. A typical 80kg bag of black tea could be bought for £90 to £100 at the beginning of the year. The company says that same bag now costs £120 to £150 at the weekly international auctions. In other words, it is paying an awful lot more for the same amount of tea. \"We don't have big enough margins between us and retailers to absorb all these costs. We're looking at how to mitigate some of them, from our labour, overheads and marketing costs, which will affect the growth of the business and employment in long run. But some of these currency costs will have to be passed on, as neither us nor the retailers can absorb any more cost\n",

Maj Collins joined 1st Battalion Irish Guards and had also served in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Northern Ireland and Iraq.

They have been asked to sign the letter acknowledging the terms and return it to the authority's legal department. It comes after the council became the first in Scotland to issue bonds on the stock exchange worth £370m. That followed credit rating agency Moody's assigning Aberdeen an Aa2 rating. It will be used to fund infrastructure projects including the new Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre (AECC) and the City Centre Masterplan. The local authority said the bonds were less expensive than other available loans. BBC Scotland understands that some councillors were initially concerned about the terms of the letter and whether it would impact on their ability to raise concerns publicly about the council's finances. Insider dealing - where a person uses inside financial information to their benefit - is a criminal offence and is punishable by a heavy fine or imprisonment. Market abuse is when someone can be given an unlimited fine for disclosing financial information that might affect the value of bonds and investments. As well as councillors, senior officials at Aberdeen City Council are also included in the insiders list that must be disclosed to the Financial Conduct Authority on request. An Aberdeen City Council spokesperson said: \"Aberdeen City Council successfully issued bonds on the London Stock Exchange in 2016 and as a result must comply with the Market Abuse Regulations. \"In line with these regulations, the council is obliged to keep a list of those individuals who have access to inside information. \"Elected members and staff who have been identified as having access to inside information relating to Aberdeen City Council have been notified in writing and asked to acknowledge receipt of that letter, which contains further detail of the insider list and its purpose. \"Training sessions on the Bond and compliance with associated regulations are under way for elected members and staff, underlining the responsibilities of the organisation and individuals. It should be stressed that the requirements for confidentiality in relation to specific subjects and issues are in line with the existing terms of employment and Councillors' Code of Conduct. \"The Bond issue was the subject of several reports to full Council in 2016, which outlined the implications of the public listing on the London Stock Exchange and made it clear it was highly likely all elected members would be on the Aberdeen City Council Insider List. These reports were considered and recommendations approved by elected members during full Council prior to the Bond issue\n",

The result meant the third-placed Clarets are one point behind both the Tigers and Middlesbrough, but have played more games than both. Media playback is not supported on this device Hull hammered Dyche's men 3-0 when the two sides last met on Boxing Day, but a repeat of that never looked likely with the hosts deserving their narrow win. Barton came close to opening the scoring after half an hour when his skidding free-kick forced a low save from McGregor before the keeper denied the same player from a header. The pivotal moment in the game came in the 77th minute when Wales international Vokes reacted quickest to McGregor's save from another Barton effort. Hull substitute Chuba Akpom had a shot saved but he could not prevent his side suffering a first defeat since 28 December.

Mr Comey announced last week that the investigation had turned up fresh emails relating to Hillary Clinton. Mr Weiner is married to Mrs Clinton's political aide Huma Abedin. In an open letter, the teenager said reporters had \"canvassed\" her area. \"Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my'story'\", she wrote. \"Why couldn't your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the centre of attention the last week of the election cycle?\" She accused the FBI director of taking a \"vague approach\" in announcing that emails had been discovered on Mr Weiner's laptop that related to Mrs Clinton.

The action sequences are huge, the soundtrack is awesome, and the people are ludicrously good looking. But it's also just totally ridiculous, which may not surprise those who have seen the trailer. Or read the somewhat less-than-kind reviews. Dwayne Johnson - the highest paid (and most annoyingly likeable) movie star in the world - takes the lead in the reboot as Mitch alongside Zac Efron, who plays Brody. Kelly Rohrbach, Alexandra Daddario and Priyanka Chopra also star, and there are, most importantly, cameo appearances from David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. (I would've thought they'd want to keep those as a surprise, personally, but their names appear in giant letters at the beginning alongside the rest of the cast.) But this incarnation of Baywatch is much more knowing and tongue-in-cheek than it was in Hasselhoff and Anderson's day. The film itself is long - presumably to allow for the slow-motion button to be used to its full potential when any character is running down the shoreline. Those who lived through the TV show will remember the appeal of such bouncy scenes, which were a key part of helping the series become a worldwide phenomenon. And a phenomenon it was. Baywatch became the most-watched television show in the world at the time and represented a huge cultural shift. Anderson was the embodiment of a look which rose to prominence in the 90s - skinny, blonde, and enhanced by plastic surgery. But strangely, the show arguably also had a moral compass, which may help explain why it got its early evening slot on TV. The lifeguards were portrayed as something of a family, working as a cohesive team and looking out for each other while saving lives. A lot of the storylines felt wholesome and saw characters doing the \"right thing\" - an odd juxtaposition with the highly sexualised elements of the series.

            "Input: summarize: Joe Cardle slotted in his eighth of the season before setting up Kallum Higginbotham to extend the Pars' lead. Dumbarton's Craig Barr hit the crossbar with a second-half header but the Sons then had Andy Dowie sent off for two bookings. Substitutes Nicky Clark and Andy Ryan added late goals to add gloss to the visitors' victory. That is four wins on the bounce for Allan Johnston's men and on this form Dunfermline appear to be more than capable of sustaining a promotion challenge. Of the six players playing in midfield or attack, only Nate Wedderburn really sits back. That security allowed Cardle, Higginbotham, Declan McManus, Dean Shiels and Callum Smith to roam forward in the first half. Cardle converted at the back post after a messy scramble following good initial play down the right by McManus. A superb counter-attack brought the Pars their second, as Higginbotham rolled the ball calmly into the far corner from a fairly tight angle. Dumbarton nearly reduced the deficit, but Barr's header bounced off the woodwork after he had connected with Tom Walsh's corner. The Sons also felt aggrieved not to be given a penalty when Ally Roy appeared to be clipped just inside the box. Dowie was given his marching orders with 15 minutes to go, before Clark made his comeback from an ankle injury to head in David Hopkirk's cross. Clark then back-heeled to tee up another substitute Ryan for a well-executed, low curled shot into the far left corner. Dunfermline manager Allan Johnston: \"I'm happy but I'm realistic as well because we know it's only the start of the season. We've started really strongly, we've got a really good, competitive squad and we've got people that can score goals. \"We're defending really well as well, so it's a good balance to have.

The Local Government Association said it was the result of \"historic under-funding\" and an ageing population. The government declined an interview but said English councils had received £9.25bn for social care. The figure for the number of cancelled contracts comes from a Freedom of Information request, which was responded to by 197 of 212 UK councils. According to the research, carried out for Panorama by Opus Restructuring and Company Watch, 69 home care companies have closed in the last three months and one in four of the UK's 2,500 home care companies is at risk of insolvency. Councillor Izzi Seccombe from the Local Government Association - which represents councils across England and Wales - said: \"We have warned that the combination of the historic under-funding of adult social care, and the significant pressures of an ageing population and the national living wage, are pushing the care provider market to the brink of collapse. \"These figures show the enormous strain providers are under, and emphasises the urgent need for a long-term, sustainable solution to the social care funding crisis.\" Many home care companies say their biggest problem is recruitment and retention of carers. The Centre for Workforce Intelligence estimates at least two million more carers will be needed by 2025 in England alone, in both in-home care and care homes, to cope with growing demand. Last October, the regulator for England, the Care Quality Commission, warned that adult social care was at a tipping point. One home care company, Cymorth Llaw, which had contracts with three councils in north Wales, told Panorama it had recently stopped working with one - Conwy, which had initially paid £14.20 an hour for care. It offered to raise that to £15, but the company decided that still wasn't enough and handed back the contract. Ken Hogg, at Cymorth Llaw, said: \"We didn't think we could do it for the money - it was as simple as that. \"We pay as much [in wages] as we possibly can and we've always paid above what was the national minimum wage and the national living wage. \"[Carers] get a mileage allowance, they get paid travelling time between their clients.\" Mr Hogg said the company was legally obliged to pay 1% pension\n",

The missile launched on Tuesday crossed Japan's northern Hokkaido island, triggering public alerts to take cover, before landing in the sea. The UN Security Council has unanimously condemned North Korea for its actions. Meeting late on Tuesday in New York, the council called the launch \"outrageous\", demanding North Korea cease all missile testing. While the statement said the regime's actions were a threat to all UN member states, it did not threaten new sanctions against Pyongyang. Russia and China said US military activity in the region was partly to blame for the increase in tensions, and urged negotiations. Arriving for a visit to Japan, British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday called on China to put more pressure on North Korea, saying that Beijing had a key role in the international response to Pyongyang's \"reckless provocation\". North Korea has repeatedly conducted missile launches in recent months, despite being barred from doing so under UN rules. The latest, a domestically made Hwasong-12, was launched early on Tuesday Korean time from a site near Pyongyang. It travelled some 2,700km (1,678 miles), at an unusually low height for North Korean missile tests, over Hokkaido before crashing about 1,180km off Japan's eastern coast. Japan sent out alerts telling people in Hokkaido to take cover. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe later called it \"unprecedented, serious and a grave threat\". For the first time, North Korea's official news agency KCNA admitted deliberately firing a ballistic missile across Japan. Previous projectiles which crossed the mainland were later claimed to have been satellite launches. It said the launch was in direct response to joint US-South Korean military drills which are currently taking place, as well as to mark the anniversary of the Japan-Korea treaty of 1910, which saw Japanese forces annex the Korean peninsula. KCNA, quoting leader Kim Jong-un, said that, \"like a real war\", the latest drill was \"the first step of the military operation of the KPA [Korean People's Army] in the Pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing Guam\".

Martin O'Neill's team had struck the woodwork and gone close several times prior to scoring. But, after taking the lead they found themselves under increasing pressure and conceded when Clark, chosen ahead of Richard Keogh in the centre of defence, headed a low cross from Zlatan Ibrahimovic into his own net. The equaliser came from one of the few moments of quality from the Sweden captain, who collected a neat backheel from substitute John Guidetti and raced to the byeline before drilling in a low cross. Jeff Hendrick drew a late save from Andreas Isaksson but there was to be no winner at the end of a feisty, scrappy match the Republic shaded but could not close out. Commitment, passion and determination were much in evidence at the Stade de France, with those workmanlike qualities comfortably eclipsing any quality and finesse on show. But, in the end, neither side had quite enough to prevail and are left to ponder a result that is hardly disastrous but not exactly what either wanted.

On 26 January - Australia's national day - Mr Abbott announced he had nominated Queen Elizabeth II's husband to receive the knighthood. He had said then that the Duke of Edinburgh's life of \"service and dedication\" should be honoured. The Queen awarded the knighthood in April.

Mr Turnbull, who used to chair Australia's republican movement, had previously defended the honours system's revival in 2014, noting that most republics have an honours system and an order of knighthood.

But between travel companies' elevated school holiday prices and the need to juggle work commitments, some parents say they cannot always go away during the school holidays and that it should be their decision to make. Hayley, 39, says she is \"fuming\" at the ruling. Together with her husband Martin, the couple, from Cheshire, took their children Archie, aged five, and Ruby, six, out of school in January to attend a family wedding in India. As Archie was under five at the time, his absence did not cause problems. But Ruby's did. Not long after they returned, letters arrived from the local council to inform them that they were being fined a total of £120. \"I'm not going to pay it,\" she said. \"They basically brandish you a criminal.\" Hayley had asked the school for permission but says she never received a reply. \"Why should you be dictated to?\" she said. \"It's made no difference to Ruby.

            "Input: summarize: The SPFL has set up a working group to examine the issue of unacceptable conduct. And it is understood that they would seek financial assistance from the Scottish government. The facial recognition system was mentioned at a meeting of all 42 clubs on Tuesday. The debate over the extent to which clubs should be held accountable for the conduct of their followers has been sparked by recent incidents involving Rangers, Celtic and Dundee United supporters. Hibernian's visit to Ibrox on 28 December was marred by sectarian chants from the home end, while there were complaints of sectarian songs during Celtic's Scottish Cup trip to Stranraer. Celtic and Dundee United have both condemned their own fans for setting off pyrotechnics. SPFL board member Mike Mulraney revealed there was not appetite to introduce new strict liability rules. The Alloa chairman said there is \"no chance whatsoever\" of clubs agreeing to regulations that could see them punished for the conduct of supporters regardless of whether the club itself is to blame. A spokesman for the league body said: \"The SPFL is working with government and other partners with the aim of establishing a workable solution to help rid our football grounds of unacceptable conduct. \"This work is at an early stage and is not being led by any one club. \"The issue of unacceptable conduct is something that the SPFL, its board and its member clubs are absolutely committed to addressing. \"Recognising that certain behaviours are for society to face and address as a whole, we believe football can take a leading role in moving this issue forward for Scottish society.\" The prospect of facial recognition technology has been met with scepticism from the Scottish Football Supporters' Association. Chairman Simon Barrow said the fans' group is concerned by \"a rushed move towards intrusive surveillance\". He added: \"There needs to be careful consultation with fans and clubs, alongside wider consideration of how to deal effectively and proportionately with threatening and insulting behaviour. \"The best way forward will involve working with the great majority of supporters who deplore such abuses, rather than making them feel under accusation themselves.\"\n",

Preston Crown Court heard Sarah Williams, 35, exchanged naked photographs with Ms Hartley's partner Ian Johnston in the weeks prior to the death. Ms Williams denies murder. The court has heard Ms Williams was obsessed by Mr Johnston, 57, and \"eliminated\" Ms Hartley with the help of Katrina Walsh, 56, who also denies murder, when he refused to leave her. Mr Johnston, who had been in an \"intermittent\", \"intimate\" relationship with communications director Ms Hartley, began a sexual relationship with Ms Williams after they met in December 2012. The former firefighter told Ms Williams the relationship was over months later, he said, but she kept contacting him in person or by text and even sent an anonymous letter to Ms Hartley, boasting the sender had had \"fantastic\" sex with Mr Johnston. John McDermott, prosecuting, said Mr Johnston and Ms Williams exchanged naked photographs on 3, 4 and 5 December last year. Mr Johnston said he didn't block the messages and responded \"in kind\" to Ms Williams' messages. But he told the prosecutor he did not seek to rekindle the relationship and was \"distraught\" when he read the texts the next day. There were further similar exchanges between the pair on Christmas Day, and again 10 days before the murder, Mr McDermott told the court. Mr Johnston had been in Switzerland when the messages in January were sent, the court heard. Mr McDermott asked: \"What were your intentions with Sarah Williams once you would return to this country?\" Mr Johnston said: \"Nothing at all. I can't recall half the text messages.\" Ms Williams and riding instructor Katrina Walsh, 56, of Hare Lane, Chester, both deny murder. Walsh is said to have played a key role in helping her friend to \"eliminate\" her love rival. The trial continues.\n",

Families work with police, the health service, voluntary sector and council to avoid violence at home. Ms Henry-Leach said parents were often reluctant to get help. \"They feel shame and stigma attached to being a victim of domestic abuse, while also fearing the consequences for their child if reported,\" she said. The programme seeks to stop children moving from one abusive relationship to another, using a \"whole-family approach\" unique to Doncaster to build families' self-esteem and resilience, Ms Henry-Leach said. Many teenagers on the programme have lived with domestic violence between parents so the project attempts to \"de-normalise\" abuse and help them move on to healthier relationships. Mother and son, Anne and Luke (not their real names) from Doncaster, said the techniques derived from University of Oxford research taught them how to listen. \"There was a lot of swearing and abusive behaviour before,\" Anne said. \"Luke never actually hit me, but he'd go to hit me, or push me which could be frightening. \"I can now sit down and talk to my son without us shouting at each other. We can actually have a conversation without being abusive.

Reports say some of the brawlers were armed with hatchets and harpoons. Unrest continued on Sunday at a protest in the regional capital. The head of the regional executive, Gilles Simeoni, has appealed for calm. The incident took place on a creek near the village of Sisco, Upper Corsica. Tension has grown this summer between local communities and Muslims of North African origin in the south of France, especially following the massacre of 85 people by a lorry driver in the city of Nice on 14 July. At the end of last month, an outlawed Corsican paramilitary group warned Islamist militants against targeting their island. Earlier this week, the resort town of Cannes controversially banned the wearing of the Islamic bathing costume for women, the burkini. Three of the injured have been released from hospital in Bastia and the other two were due to be sent home shortly, prosecutors said in a statement (in French). They described the brawl as being of \"great violence\". French media report that the trouble began around 18:15 (16:15 GMT) when tourists took photos of women bathing. Reports say the women were wearing burkinis. Ange Vivoni, mayor of Sisco, told reporters that when a local teenager was stabbed, the victim's \"family and all the people of Sisco got together\". According to the newspaper Le Figaro (in French), some of the older men in the bathing party had attacked a group of local teenagers on the beach with hatchets. When the teenagers' parents arrived from the village, two of them were reportedly injured with harpoons. Villagers allegedly then set alight cars belonging to the bathers. Another French daily, Le Monde, reports (in French) that one man was injured twice by a harpoon after his son was beaten up. Stones and bottles were also thrown.

They were under the protection of about 600 lightly armed Dutch infantry forces. Fuel was running out and no fresh food had been brought into the enclave since May. Serb forces began shelling Srebrenica. Bosnian Muslim fighters in the town asked for the return of weapons they had surrendered to the peacekeepers but their request was refused. The Dutch commander called UN Headquarters in Sarajevo asking for \"close air support\" after shells and rockets landed close to refugee centres and observation posts manned by peacekeepers. 9 July 1995: The Bosnian Serbs stepped up their shelling and thousands of refugees fled to the town from southern camps ahead of advancing Serbs, who attacked Dutch observation posts, taking about 30 soldiers hostage. One peacekeeper was fatally wounded when Bosnian Muslims fired on retreating Dutch troops. 10 July 1995: Dutch Commander Col Karremans filed a request for UN air support after the Bosnian Serbs shelled Dutch positions. UN Commander Gen Janvier initially refused, but agreed after another request from the colonel. Serb attacks stopped before the planes arrived and strikes were postponed. Some 4,000 refugees were in the town by the evening and there was panic on the streets. Large crowds were gathered around the Dutch positions. The Dutch commander told town leaders that Nato planes would launch massive air attacks against the Serbs if they had not withdrawn from the safe area by 06:00 the following morning. 11 July 1995: The Serb forces did not withdraw, but at 09:00 Col Karremans received word from Sarajevo that his request for close air support had been submitted on the wrong form.

At Badgeworth, the tiny nature reserve boasts a small crop of the plant but in South Gloucestershire the buttercup is only spotted once every five years. Plant expert Richard Lansdown said: \"We wouldn't normally reintroduce but Inglestone is down to a single plant.\" The species, more commonly known as the Badgeworth buttercup, relies on bare, wet ground that has been churned up by cattle to set seed and thrive. But with fewer animals grazing the common in recent years, it has become overrun with scrub and the buttercup now \"only grows intermittently\" at a single pond. \"I sieved out the mud and extracted all the seeds [at Inglestone] and didn't find any from the Badgeworth buttercup - there weren't any left at all,\" said Mr Lansdown. \"So we've had to use seed originally collected from the site some years ago that was sent to the Millennium Seed Bank.\" Using the 270 plus seeds held at Kew, 200 plants were propagated and about 80 planted out at Inglestone with a further planting planned for mid-June \"The two sites have been declining for a very, very long time,\" said Mr Lansdown. \"But we've planted out 83 plants in different locations at Inglestone and at least half of them are surviving and doing well and have begun fruiting which will add to the seed bank.\"\n",

More than 1.6 million people are also displaced within South Sudan, meaning about 20% of the population have been made homeless since December 2013. A fragile peace deal signed last year is on the brink of collapse. \"The violence in July came as a major setback to peace efforts in South Sudan,\" the UNHCR spokesman Leo Dobbs said in a statement. The UN says more than 185,000 people have fled South Sudan since July. \"The fighting has shattered hopes for a real breakthrough and triggered new waves of displacement and suffering, while humanitarian organisations are finding it very difficult for logistical, security and funding reasons to provide urgent protection and assistance to the hundreds of thousands in need,\" Mr Dobbs said. South Sudan refugees: Many of the refugees arriving in Uganda, which hosts the most South Sudanese, are \"exhausted after days walking in the bush and going without food or water. Many children have lost one or both of their parents\", the UNHCR says. A fall-out between President Salva Kiir and former Vice-President Machar - the most powerful members of their respective Dinka and Nuer ethnic groups - led to the civil war which erupted in December 2013. They only agreed to settle their differences under intense international pressure, signing a peace deal in August 2015 - and Mr Machar returned to Juba as vice-president in a unity government in April. But battles then broke out between his bodyguards and presidential guards three months later, prompting him to flee. Another member of his party has been appointed as vice-president, a move Mr Machar does not recognise. Earlier this week, a report funded by George Clooney accused both Mr Kiir and Mr Machar, as well as their officials, of personally profiting from the war. Both men have denied the allegations. The UN wants to deploy a 4,000-strong regional protection force for Juba which would have a more robust mandate than the 12,000 UN soldiers already in the country, however the mandate and size of the force still have to be agreed.

She wants a 50p tax on those earning over £150,000, and a penny increase in income tax to pay for public services. The conference will vote on Tuesday on plans to give the Scottish and Welsh leaders more power over their parties. The proposals would allow Kezia Dugdale and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones the power to appoint a representative to the party's UK national executive committee (NEC). The plans would also give the Scottish and Welsh parties more autonomy. Sources have said there was an attempt to \"unpick\" the plans by removing the extra seats from the package. This was defeated, but it is possible there could be a second attempt prior to Tuesday's vote. Speaking at the weekend, Len McCluskey, head of the UK's biggest trade union Unite, said Ms Dugdale should not have the power to appoint Scotland's representative on the NEC. He said that while there was wide support for the autonomy proposals, coupling them with the NEC seat plans had created a \"difficult position\". Ms Dugdale has said she is confident the full package will be passed. It appears Kezia Dugdale and Jeremy Corbyn are involved in their first dispute since his re-election.

Billington noted that the show had \"none of the epic scale of the original London production\" but added this was to the producers' credit: \"Sometimes semi-staged is better than the luxurious grandeur of an elephantine West End musical.\" Glenn Close is reprising the role of Norma Desmond, a character she first played in Los Angeles in 1993. She won a Tony award for her Broadway performance in 1995. Holly Williams from theatre website WhatsOnStage said: \"It might be 20 years since she bagged a Tony in this part, but I wouldn't bet against her scooping a few shiny new gongs this time round.\" However, some critics did note that Close's voice occasionally struggled with the higher notes. \"[Close's] vocal instrument may not be as sharp as it once was, but she brings an utterly ferocious intensity to the part and the songs,\" Mark Shenton wrote in his review for The Stage. Time Out also had some criticisms of the production: \"Like many later Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals, Sunset Boulevard is not brilliant.\" Andrzej Lukowski added that \"69-year-old Close is definitely a bit old to play 50-year-old silent movie star Norma Desmond\".

The Klos-C, a Panamanian-flagged vessel, is currently being escorted to the southern Israeli port of Eilat, and is expected to arrive on Saturday. Its 17-member crew were apparently unaware of their cargo. The Klos-C was transporting dozens of M-302 rockets, which have a range of 150km to 200km (93-124 miles), Israeli military spokesman Brig-Gen Moti Almoz said. \"The ship may be carrying other weapons as well, but we can only know this when it reaches Eilat.\" \"There is clear and unequivocal information that this came from Iran.\" On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had tracked the weapons for several months as they were flown from Damascus to Tehran and then taken to a port in southern Iran. From there, it added, they were loaded on to the KLOS-C, which sailed to Iraq, where containers of cement were added. The ship was eventually intercepted while on its way to Sudan.

The group were allegedly promised $250,000 (£192,000) to kill Nemtsov. They all denied the charges. Nemtsov's relatives fear that whoever ordered the murder will never be found. Russian authorities are still looking for another Chechen said to be behind the killing, Ruslan Mukhudinov. He believed to have fled abroad. But lawyers for Nemtsov's family have said the investigators have exaggerated Mr Mukhudinov's role and \"the masterminds are high-ranking people\". The jury in Moscow convicted the five men after more than eight months of hearings. Zaur Dadayev is former member of an elite military unit. He was under the command of pro-Moscow's Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia's Chechen Republic in the North Caucasus. The other four defendants are brothers Anzor Gubashev and Shadid Gubashev, Khamzat Bakhayev and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov. A sixth man, Beslan Shabanov, died while he was being detained in Chechnya. Nemtsov served as first deputy prime minister under President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, and later became a vocal critic of President Putin. The 55-year-old was shot dead on 27 February 2015 on his way from a restaurant in central Moscow. Earlier that day he was interviewed on a liberal radio station, in which he had called on listeners to join a rally. At the time, Nemtsov was working on a report examining Russia's alleged role in the conflict in Ukraine. President Putin called the murder \"vile and cynical\" and vowed to hold those responsible to account. Russia has seen several killings of high-profile politicians and journalists in recent years. But the country has a long history of prosecuting alleged hit-men and failing to follow the chain of command to discover who ordered the murder, correspondents say.

A not guilty plea was entered on Mr Terry's behalf at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. He will now stand trial on 9 July, nine days after Euro 2012.

Following Wednesday's hearing, the footballer's legal team said in a statement: \"Mr Terry looks forward to the opportunity to clear his name. By Dan RoanBBC Sports News Correspondent The fact that Terry will not stand trial until July means he is now free to lead England into the European Championship, the Football Association, along with Chelsea, having made clear it will not suspend him. However, it also means these serious charges will hang over him for a further five months. Terry says he does not wish to talk about the case, but you can be sure he will be asked. Some will worry about the effect this uncertainty will have over on his performances in the summer and the England team's morale. \"Mr Terry denies making any racist statement and will establish in court that he is not guilty of any such offence. \"Mr Terry has never racially abused another player in his entire career.'' Police questioned Mr Terry under caution in November and a file on the matter was sent to the CPS at the beginning of December. The decision to charge Mr Terry was taken after police received a complaint from a member of the public after the Premier League match at Loftus Road.

A navy spokesman accused the Iranians of behaving in an \"unsafe and unprofessional\" manner. Tensions between the countries are high with the Gulf a potential flashpoint. US Naval Forces Central Command spokesman Commander Bill Urban said the incident happened in international air space as an F/A-18E Super Hornet was preparing to land on the USS Nimitz. Despite radio warnings to stay clear of the carrier, the drone carried out \"unsafe and unprofessional\" altitude changes near the jet, he said. \"The dangerous manoeuvre by the QOM-1 [drone] in the known vicinity of fixed-wing flight operations and at coincident altitude with operating aircraft created a collision hazard and is not in keeping with international maritime customs and laws,\" Cdr Urban said. The incident is the latest in a series of close encounters in the Gulf between US and Iranian forces. In July, a US Navy ship fired warning shots at an Iranian Revolutionary Guard vessel after it came within 140m (450ft) and ignored radio calls.

The CSE has urged the government to ban the use of these chemicals in bakery products. \"Considering that it [potassium bromate] can cause cancer, is banned in most parts of the world, and has healthy alternatives, there is no reason why this chemical should be allowed, specifically when residues are found to be present in the end-product.\" The CSE said potassium iodate should also be banned because \"it can potentially affect the functioning of thyroid\".

Southampton City Council estimates the port contributes up to 23 per cent of air pollution in the city. Ships can use a \"plug-in\" system to reduce emissions but not in the UK. It comes after the World Health Organisation (WHO) called Southampton one of the most polluted cities in the UK. The city's port welcomes thousands of ships a year, including some of the biggest cruise liners and container ships in the world. The vessels leave their engines running while docked to power their electrics, but elsewhere in the world ships use a shore-based electricity supply, virtually eliminating their emissions. Cargo and cruise ships, including the Queen Mary 2 and Britannia which regularly dock in Southampton, use the method - just not when visiting the British port. Port Director Alastair Welch from ABP said: \"The challenge has been in particular there is no one standard for shore power. I'd like it in place as soon as possible. \"I should emphasise shore power is not the only answer and that's why we're working with solar power and hybrid ships now, because all of them have a part to play for the future.\" A review of Air Quality in Southampton in 2015 by the local authority showed the port is believed to contribute between seven and 23 per cent of the air pollution, while cars contribute 18 per cent and HGVs 12 per cent. The government has since told Southampton to implement clean air zones by 2020 and the council is implementing a Clean Air Strategy to meet national goals.\n",

The two shared a stage at Winston-Salem in North Carolina. Introducing Mrs Obama, the former first lady said her voice was needed in this election \"more than ever\". Mrs Clinton referred to Mr Trump's ongoing feud with the Khans and accused him of \"rubbing salt into the wounds of a grieving family\". Mr Khan's son Humayun was killed by a car bomb in 2004 in Iraq at the age of 27. Their grief became part of the presidential campaign in July when Khizr Khan made an emotional speech at the Democratic Convention attacking Mr Trump for anti-Muslim rhetoric, as his wife stood next to him. The Republican candidate's reaction, in which he implied the mother was not allowed to speak up, attracted strong condemnation from within his own party. Speaking to ABC News in an interview aired on Thursday, Mr Trump repeated his insistence that their son would be alive, but added he believed the soldier was a \"great hero\". In response, Mr Khan said: \"This is the most cruel thing you can say to grieving parents, that if I was there this would not have happened.\" In other campaign developments: Former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh tweeted: \"On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump.

The taskforce has warned that the number of people falling behind on their mortgage payments could increase as interest rates begin to rise. The taskforce is now undertaking further work aimed at developing policy recommendations. Northern Ireland suffered a huge housing bubble followed by a crash that saw prices fall by almost 50%. As a consequence, rates of negative equity are much worse than elsewhere in the UK and repossessions have also increased. A major \"at risk\" group identified by the taskforce are households who undertook \"equity release\" remortgages at the height of the market. They are people who increased their mortgages to release cash for other purposes, such as home improvements or to finance buy-to-let properties. In 2007, 74% of remortgaging in Northern Ireland was for equity release. The taskforce said this category of \"credit hungry\" borrower was disproportionately active in Northern Ireland. Lower income groups who took out \"second charge\" mortgages with subprime lenders are also at high-risk. The taskforce said those lenders have shown \"a more tenacious approach to arrears management\". However, it said, in general, lenders have shown \"forbearance\" and if they had not done so rates of repossessions would be higher. The taskforce warned that, despite a gradual recovery in the Northern Ireland economy and the housing market, major risks remain. It said that the Northern Ireland economy \"remains some distance from reaching escape velocity\"' and that borrowers are \"poorly equipped to absorb future income shocks\".\n",

In 1979, the Sandinista revolution overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza and Borge served as interior minister in the new government of Daniel Ortega. US President Ronald Reagan saw the revolutionaries as a threat and backed the right-wing Contras in the civil war that followed. An estimated 30,000 people died in the fighting which lasted a decade and wrecked the country's economy. Borge was born into a poor family and dedicated himself to the struggle against the Somoza family, which had run Nicaragua for 40 years. He received military training in Cuba before he helped to found the Sandinista movement. The organisation was named after Augusto Cesar Sandino, who fought against US intervention in Nicaragua in the 1930s. Borge became the powerful interior minister in the Ortega government of the 1980s, where he imposed censorship on the media and was accused of human rights violations. However, he denied accusations that he was responsible for expelling and harassing clergymen during the war. The Sandinistas were voted out of power in 1990. Congressman Jacinto Suarez was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying Borge was \"a transcendental figure in Nicaraguan history\". But the news agency also quoted Nicaraguan writer Gioconda Belli, who said of Borge's later life: \"After 1990, I have the sense he gave up his revolutionary ideas... He ended up a tragic-comic figure\". Borge's final years saw Daniel Ortega return to government - he won presidential elections in 2006 and again in 2011.

Thys reckoned I lacked pace.'' Thys said: \"He'd come up to me and ask me why I did not play him. 'Boss, I am the best player, aren't I?' And then I would tell him he was not. He could not believe that. \"I do admit he had by far the strongest personality of all the players I have come across.

When she travelled down to Sussex for the funeral, her mother handed her the box with the vintage wedding dress from 1951, and everything fell into place. \"When I tried it on, it fitted perfectly,\" she said. \"I had it cleaned but I didn't have to do anything else to it. \"I had tried on brand new wedding dresses and I had fallen in love with one, but this felt different and so special. \"It meant so much to us as a family for me to wear it and, as you can imagine, it made for a very emotional day.\" London-based digital designer Emily Clark also hopes to start a tradition of her own by using her mother's frock for her wedding this October.

Bradbury, 41, from Herringswell in Suffolk, was jailed at Cambridge Crown Court for sexual assault, voyeurism and possessing more than 16,000 indecent images. The court heard the images of his victims were taken in the hospital. Victims told investigators Bradbury had focused on examining their private parts when there was no medical need to do so. The child, who is now 13, was referred to Bradbury because his older sister had a blood disorder and it was feared he might have the same condition. But, his mother said, there was nothing wrong with him. Instead of discharging him from his patient list, Bradbury continued seeing and abusing the boy for a year. The boy is currently on heavy medication to deal with the mental effects of his abuse. His mother said she did not know how Bradbury could appeal.

Last month several retailers dropped Ms Trump's label, citing falling sales. In an interview with fashion magazine Refinery29, Ms Klem declined to cite specific sales figures, but research by a market analytics firm seems to support the claim. According to Lyst, a London-based e-commerce website which tracks clothing retail, sales of Ivanka Trump products rocketed in February. It says sales increased 346% from January to February this year and 557%, compared with average orders last year. \"To see such an extreme spike in one month is completely unheard of and came as a huge surprise to us,\" says Lyst's US spokesperson Sarah Tanner. Ms Klem said that most products are sold to women in New York, California and Texas, and the average shopper earns between $60,000-100,000 per year (£50,000-£82,000).

For most women seeking an abortion, the only option is to travel to the UK to pay for the procedure. Manx campaign group, CALM (Campaign for Abortion Law Modernisation), which was established in April, wants island legislation to be brought in line with the UK. Although it is not currently illegal, the group said it is \"almost impossible\" for women to have a termination on the Isle of Man. A spokesman added: \"The current act is incredibly restrictive. We are not saying abortion should be available to everyone at the drop of a hat.\" Anti-abortion campaigners at the rally held banners saying: \"Thou shalt not kill\". A spokesman said: \"I'm part of a group which is here to represent the rights of unborn babies.\" Chief Minister Allan Bell said the legislation was due to be reviewed after the Isle of Man's general election in September.\n",

But he said on Wednesday it was cheap, \"doable\" and humane. Democratic President Barack Obama wants to lift the threat of deportation to millions of undocumented people. But his plan to allow about four million people to apply for work permits has been hindered by legal challenges. Mr Trump, a billionaire New Yorker who has been leading in the polls, defended his plan to build a wall on the US-Mexico border and deport all the people living illegally in the US. \"You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely,\" he told MSNBC's Morning Joe. \"You have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and they're waiting to come in legally.\" How do you deport 11m people? Debate exposes Republican divisions He pointed to the actions of former US President Dwight Eisenhower, who authorised what was probably the largest deportation operations in US history. Senator Ted Cruz backed Mr Trump during the debate, condemning any form of \"amnesty\" because illegal immigration kept wages low for American workers. But his fellow Republican, Ohio Governor John Kasich, said that mass deportation was a \"silly argument\" that could never work and would split families. The issue has exposed the diverging views within the party, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio clarified his stance on Wednesday. He described his position as a \"very long path\" to citizenship when people had spent at least 10 years on a work permit.\n",

He promised to provide further details on Thursday. One expert said the plan would probably enrage many of the site's users. Last week, Reddit's previous chief executive, Ellen Pao, resigned after an online petition calling for her dismissal attracted more than 213,000 signatures. The petition had accused Ms Pao of leading the site into a \"new age of censorship\" after five \"subreddit communities\" run by volunteers had been banned for failing to tackle the \"harassment of individuals\". However, one of Reddit's other former chief executives - who no longer works for the company - has since suggested that Ms Pao was less minded to restrict users' activities than many of her critics had assumed. \"On at least two separate occasions, the board pressed [Ms Pao] to outright ban all the hate subreddits in a sweeping purge. She resisted,\" wrote Yishan Wong. \"She probably would have tolerated your existence so long as you didn't cause any problems. I know that her long-term strategies were to find ways to surface and publicise Reddit's good parts - allowing the bad parts to exist but keeping them out of the spotlight.\" Reddit attracted more than 163 million visitors last month, according to its own figures, making it one of the net's most popular destinations. Mr Huffman co-founded Reddit in 2005 and was announced as the site's new chief last week, following Ms Pao's resignation. In a message posted to the site on Tuesday, he said his top priority was to develop a \"comprehensive content policy\" and tools to enforce it. \"The overwhelming majority of content on Reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities.

A former Kremlin power-broker whose fortunes declined under Mr Putin, Mr Berezovsky emigrated to the UK in 2000. Thames Valley Police said the death, at a property in Ascot, Berkshire, was being treated as unexplained. The area around the property has been cordoned off to allow the investigation to take place, the force said. The inquiry was at a very early stage and more details will be released when available, it added. A South Central Ambulance Service spokeswoman said it had been called to the property at 15:18 GMT. \"We sent a number of ambulance officers and an ambulance to the address. The 67-year-old male was confirmed deceased at the scene,\" she said. Last year, Mr Berezovsky lost a £3bn ($4.7bn) damages claim against Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich. Mr Berezovsky claimed he had been intimidated by Mr Abramovich into selling shares in Russian oil giant Sibneft for a \"fraction of their true worth\". The allegations were completely rejected by the London Commercial Court judge, who called Mr Berezovsky an \"inherently unreliable\" witness. By Steve RosenbergMoscow correspondent, BBC News Russians have little sympathy for oligarchs, whether alive or dead. That's because while Boris Berezovsky - and the tiny number of other tycoons - were striking rich in the 1990s, millions of people here were sliding into poverty. As he gained in power, many Russians saw Berezovsky as the \"grey cardinal\" in the Kremlin - exerting huge political influence for his own benefit. Having fled to London, he became a vocal Kremlin critic and pledged to work from self-imposed exile to depose President Putin. But back home in Russia, many of Mr Putin's opponents blamed Berezovsky for having engineered the transfer of power from Yeltsin to Putin. Boris Berezovsky will be remembered as a tower\n",

There were angry confrontations outside Downing Street on Wednesday between protesters demanding Mr Netanyahu's arrest for what they say amount to war crimes in Gaza and pro-Israel activists. Although a petition calling for the Israeli PM's arrest secured enough signatures to be considered for a debate in Parliament, the bid was rejected earlier this week because \"visiting heads of foreign governments... have immunity from legal process, and cannot be arrested or detained\", the UK government said in a statement.

The victory margin was a surprise - many analysts had predicted a tighter race after four opposition parties united behind Mr Lowassa's candidature. It boiled down to Mr Magufuli's popularity, which superseded that of the governing Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) that has dominated politics since independence from British rule in 1961. So what are the five big challenges he faces once in office? Change was the buzzword during the election campaign. Now people will expect him to engage in a major house-cleaning exercise by showing the door to corrupt government officials and old-school public servants. This will pose a huge political risk, as they are well-entrenched in CCM. But Mr Magufuli, the former works minister, will have to tackle corruption head-on, as Tanzanians have had enough of it. His first big test will come with the appointment of a cabinet. Will it be made up of people untainted by corruption? If not, voters will be disappointed. After all, he has built his political career on the promise that he is not scared of taking risks, and that he works hard and acts fast. Although the official unemployment rate is at around 10%, people sometimes get the impression that the crisis bigger - a recent advert for 70 jobs in the public service posts attracted more than 10,000 applications. Interviews had to be held in a football stadium. Almost half of Tanzania's 50 million-strong population is made up of young people, and they are worst-affected by unemployment. They voted with great enthusiasm, believing their fortunes will change under Mr Magufuli. He will be under most pressure from them to deliver on his promise to create jobs - and end poverty. He has promised to revive industries which are in bad shape, like the cotton and fish processing sectors. Mr Magufuli has promised children free education from kindergarten to secondary school. While many Tanzanians welcome this, they feel it is not enough. They want a higher standard of education with improved curriculums so that Tanzania can have a better-skilled work force.

The firm, with three million customers, said it had kept bills to the same level in real terms as in 2001. Meanwhile, research by Cardiff University claims the company is worth £1bn a year to the Welsh economy. Its financial results come in a different form to companies with shares on the stock market. It is owned by the not-for-profit company Glas Cymru and savings or efficiencies are ploughed back into Dwr Cymru or used to keep bills as low as possible. Mr Annett, with Mr Jones, founded Glas Cymru 12 years ago, and he said the idea stems from the notion that having a public service company, which is a monopoly, being run on the basis of profit maximisation for shareholders does not work in the customers' interest. He said there were cases where the Glas Cymru non-profit model of ownership could work elsewhere in other businesses and industries. Mr Jones said of the job awaiting him: \"There are some big challenges ahead. \"We're a company that has to have a long-term vision, looking to invest in assets that will be around for the next for the next 20, 30 and 40 years, so we have to make the right decisions. \"We have to balance that investment with the need to strive to keep bills down for our customers as well because everyone is feeling the pinch in difficult circumstances.\" Research also published on Thursday by Cardiff Business School said that Dwr Cymru contributes £1bn into the Welsh economy every year. The study claims for every £1 spent by the company, another 56p is generated for the rest of the Welsh economy. The report also quotes the water regulator Ofwat saying that between 2009/10 and 2014/15 Dwr Cymru customers face the lowest increase in average household bills of all water and sewerage companies in England and Wales.

The $238bn (£158bn) raised would be used to fund road projects in the US. But analysts say it is unlikely the Republican-controlled Congress will approve the proposals. Mr Obama told broadcaster NBC that despite several years of economic improvement, wages and incomes for middle class families were \"just now ticking up\". \"They haven't been keeping pace over the last 30 years compared to, you know, corporate profits and what's happening to folks in the very top,\" he said. Research firm Audit Analytics calculated last April that US firms in total had $2.1tn-worth of profits stashed abroad. It found US conglomerate General Electric had the most profit stored overseas at $110bn. Tech giants Microsoft and Apple and drugs companies Pfizer and Merck all featured in the top five. No tax is currently due on foreign profits as long as they are not brought into the US. As a result some companies put their earnings in low tax jurisdictions and simply leave them there. The White House said its plans for an immediate 14% tax would raise $238bn, which would be used to fund a wider $478bn public works programme of road, bridge and public transport upgrades. \"This transition tax would mean that companies have to pay US tax right now on the $2tn they already have overseas, rather than being able to delay paying any US tax indefinitely,\" a White House official said. The official said that after this one-off tax, the 19% permanent tax firms would have to pay on overseas profits \"would level the playing field, and encourage firms to create jobs here at home.\" The tax rate is far lower than the current US top corporate tax rate of 35%. Also expected in Mr Obama's budget proposal is a tax cut on earned incomes, including tax credits for child care and \"second earners\". Mr Obama will also seek to ease restrictions on military and domestic spending in place since a budget deal in 2011. Republicans in Congress have largely rejected many of Mr Obama's proposals for increased domestic spending and tax rises on corporations but support increased military spending.

I'm playing a young player - it is a big challenge.\" After recovering from a set and 5-1 down against Elina Svitolina in the quarter-final, Halep led from the front against Pliskova. With the number-one ranking and the prospect of a first Grand Slam title on the line, it was Halep who grasped the opportunity. The 25-year-old broke serve in game three as her speed and accuracy proved too much for the wayward Pliskova. The Czech made 24 errors in losing the first set, but finally edged ahead at 4-2 in the second. Pliskova, 25, had said throughout the tournament that she was surprised at her progress on the clay, but for half an hour her powerful hitting held sway and there was little Halep could do. The Romanian was under pressure early in the decider but finally chased down a forehand and fired a brilliant cross-court winner to grab a 3-1 lead. Pliskova would cut the deficit to 4-3 only to blaze a forehand long, leaving Halep to serve out the match after two hours. Ostapenko was well into uncharted territory, ranked 47th and having never been past the third round at a Grand Slam before, but she relished the big stage.

Hebrew graffiti found on a wall is thought to indicate the attack may have been the work of Jewish extremists. Police detained 16 teenagers for questioning but later released them. Spokeswoman Luba Samri told the AFP news agency that they were freed \"with no conditions attached, after being interviewed and giving statements\". The BBC's Kevin Connolly in Jerusalem says Tabgha is a sacred site to the many thousands of Christian pilgrims who visit the Holy Land every year. The arson attack on the Church of the Multiplication of the Loaves and Fishes caused extensive damage to a book shop and other buildings at the complex but did not destroy the 5th Century mosaic floors which are its key archaeological feature. Two people who had been staying at the complex were also taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation. A verse from a Hebrew prayer denouncing the worship of \"idols\" was found spray-painted in red on a wall of the church. Our correspondents say the graffiti will suggest to many that the attack is part of a sporadic campaign by a small group of right-wing Jewish extremists against non-Jewish targets in Israel, but police said it was too early to tell. \"The torching of the church is a cowardly and despicable act which contradicts Israel's basic values,\" Internal Security Minister Gilad Erdan said in a statement.

Ms Palmer-Tomkinson said the tumour was discovered after she went for blood tests after feeling ill in the summer of 2015. She said: \"'I actually feel very lucky.

But pregnant women should make sure they take folic acid and vitamin D, as well as eating a well-balanced diet, as per NHS guidelines, they add. Supplements-makers said some women were not getting enough nutrients. The researchers said folic acid had the strongest evidence to support its use - taking 400 micrograms a day can protect against abnormalities called neural tube defects in the developing baby. Vitamin D - 10 micrograms a day - is recommended for healthy bones in the mother and baby. Some women can get these two pills for free on the Healthy Start scheme. A supplement that can be dangerous in pregnancy is vitamin A. Too much can harm the baby. The researchers said pregnant women might feel coerced into buying expensive multivitamins in order to give their baby the best start in life. But they would do well to resist the marketing claims, which did not seem to translate into better outcomes for mother or baby, they said. \"The only supplements recommended for all women during pregnancy are folic acid and vitamin D, which are available at relatively low cost,\" they said. Janet Fyle, from the Royal College of Midwives, said: \"We would encourage women who are pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant to have a healthy, varied diet including fresh fruit and vegetables, alongside taking folic acid supplements. \"We would also stress that there is no need for pregnant women to 'eat for two'. \"This is a myth, and all that is required is a normal balanced amount of food.\" The Health Food Manufacturers' Association, which represents the food supplements industry, insists that a substantial proportion of women of child-bearing age are not getting enough nutrients from diet alone.

But Warburton played down accusations that their goal-scoring has dried up, and pointed to their goal difference of 31 after 14 games, which he said speaks volumes about the potency of his squad. \"Other teams have gone on a very, very good run of form and teams who dropped points at the start of the season have put a run together,\" he said. \"All credit to them as it's hard to put a run together at any time in football. So I don't think it's Rangers' form dipping, it's other teams improving. \"If we are 10, 11 or 12 points clear and we lose three games of football, while the other teams win their games, then I would agree (there is a crisis). Rangers currently sit level with Hibernian on points at the Championship summit, topping the table on goal difference, but have a game in hand over the Edinburgh outfit.

Political, economic and social stability have given it one of the highest standards of living in the developing world.

The country's public debt rose sharply in 2009-11, mainly because of a slowdown in the tourism and financial services sectors. Prior to the economic crisis there was a construction boom, with new hotels and housing complexes springing up. The trend accelerated as the island prepared to host some of the key Cricket World Cup matches in 2007. However, a shortage of jobs has prompted many Barbadians - more often known as Bajans - to find work abroad. The money that they send home is an important source of income.

Events have certainly moved quickly. A year ago France was in the middle of a nasty spat over warships which it was refusing to sell to Vladimir Putin. For France, the Russian leader was a destabilising presence on Europe's eastern borders. EU sanctions - intended to contain Russian ambitions in Crimea and Ukraine - had full French backing. Today there are more pressing concerns. In the wake of the Paris attacks, President Hollande had a vision of a single, united international coalition - the nations of the world working together to eradicate IS. Realities have since deflated that ambition. The Americans and the Russians are not going to work together any time soon. And the Turko-Russian crisis over the downed Sukhoi Russian warplane is a further complication. But still, the French want as many countries on side as possible. And the Russians - by dint of their military presence in Syria - are a major player. As one diplomatic official told Le Monde: \"Right now we are probably more prepared to work with the Russians than Barack Obama is.\" President Hollande has two goals in his talks with Vladimir Putin. First he wants to persuade Russia to direct its airstrikes away from the \"moderate\" Syrian opposition and onto targets belonging to IS. Second, he wants a firmer understanding that Russia will not stick indefinitely behind Bashar al-Assad. The French feel they have made a significant change in policy by de-prioritising the removal of the Syrian leader. It took a good deal of pride-swallowing to make the concession, because until two weeks ago Paris was President Assad's greatest scourge. But there is only so far that the French will go down this line. And they feel Russia should also give some slack. There are a number of factors in favour of a rapprochement.

A decision whether to turn off his life support machines is being considered by the High Court. Connie Yates and Chris Gard want to take their son who has progressive muscle weakness to the US. A crowdfunding campaign for the trip is now less than £60,000 short of its £1.3m target. The judge is analysing medical evidence at a hearing in the Family Division before deciding what option is in Charlie's best interests. The neurologist who would oversee the treatment told the court that while Charlie was in the \"terminal stage\" of his illness, treating him would be compassionate. He said the therapy, which would be tried for six months, would provide a \"small chance\" of a meaningful improvement in Charlie's brain function. \"[Charlie] may be able to interact. To smile. To look at objects,\" he said. Sophia Roper, representing Charlie's parents, also told the court there was \"no evidence that he is on a regular basis in pain\". Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital said the baby receives 24-hour care and should be allowed to die with dignity. But the couple, who live in London, believe seven-month-old Charlie may have a chance of surviving if he receives treatment abroad. \"We just want to have our chance. It would never be a cure but it could help him live. If it saves him, amazing,\" Miss Yates said. \"I want to save others. Even if Charlie doesn't make it through this, I don't ever want another mum and their child to go through this.\" Though born healthy in August, Charlie began to lose weight and strength by the time he was eight weeks old. He was admitted to Great Ormond Street in October after developing aspiration pneumonia and was diagnosed with mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Last month, his parents told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme they would continue to fight for their child's survival. They said: \"He can move his mouth, he can move his hands. He can't open them fully, but he can still open his eyes and see us, in response to us.\" An online campaign raised an initial £1.2m, but an extra £100,000 is now needed to help pay fees on the Go\n",

Mr Barrymore, who was not present for the High Court decision, values his claim at more than £2.4m. Essex Police said there were still \"unanswered\" questions over Mr Lubbock's death. Michael Barrymore: How the British TV king lost his crown A figure for the damages to be paid to Mr Barrymore - whose real name is Michael Parker - is yet to be set. Mr Barrymore was arrested in 2007 in connection with the 31-year-old's death. Mr Justice Stuart-Smith, sitting in London on Friday, ruled against the force, which had argued Mr Barrymore should only receive a nominal payout. The judge did not decide on the sum to be awarded, as his ruling dealt only with the preliminary issue of the level of damages to be awarded to Mr Barrymore. The case centred on whether Essex Police had reasonable grounds to lawfully arrest Mr Barrymore. While Mr Justice Stuart-Smith found there was \"information available to the police that could have provided an arresting officer with reasonable grounds for a lawful arrest\" the one officer with sufficient information to carry it out was not there at the time the entertainer was arrested. That officer was stuck in traffic at the time, Essex Police said. As a result, said Mr Justice Stuart-Smith, the arrest was unlawful and Mr Barrymore was therefore \"entitled to recover more than nominal damages\". During a previous hearing, a lawyer for Mr Barrymore told how the arrest had affected his client. Hugh Tomlinson QC said Mr Barrymore, the former host of My Kind Of People and Strike it Lucky, was never charged with any offence and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) later made it \"crystal clear\" there was no basis for any charges. He said Mr Barrymore remained convinced that Mr Lubbock's injuries were not caused at his home but he did not know what happened. He added: \"This arrest was made without any proper evidential foundation. \"However, the fact that it had happened, and the worldwide publicity it received, destroyed the claimant's career.\" In a statement issued after the High Court hearing, Essex Police said: \"Today's judgement must not overshadow\n",

The grave was discovered on Thursday and the number of bodies found since has risen from seven to 14. Forensic experts are continuing with their search and have not ruled out finding more bodies buried on the prison grounds. On Friday, prison minister Iris Varela wrote on Twitter that she had contacted the relatives of two inmates to ask for their help identifying the remains. The two prisoners disappeared when inmates were relocated from the General Penitentiary of Venezuela to other jails in October. An estimated 9,000 prisoners were locked up in the jail near the town of San Juan de los Morros prior to its closure, according to non-governmental organisation A Window on Freedom. The NGO says Venezuelan jails are woefully overcrowded and that last year 173 inmates died while in custody. But Ms Varela told Venezuelan state broadcaster VTV that the country had taken huge steps to improve the conditions of its prisons. She said that all of the country's women's and youth prisons had been brought up to new standards set by the Venezuelan government. \"This is an achievement without precedent of the Bolivarian Revolution and the government of our president, Nicolas Maduro,\" she said. She said that President Maduro had asked her in 2014 to \"impose maximum discipline\" in Venezuelan jails. \"Well, here I am fulfilling the president's orders,\" she said.

Its intervention has been heavily criticised by Turkey, the US and Gulf Arab states. Mr Putin said the downing of the Russian jet by Turkish warplanes on the Syria-Turkey border was a \"hostile act\" but Russia was \"not the country\" to run away. He said he saw \"no prospect\" of ties improving with Turkey - which Russia has put under sanctions - under its current leaders. There was, he said, a \"creeping Islamisation of Turkey that would have Ataturk rolling in his grave\".

Around 100,000 people in the United Kingdom have multiple sclerosis or MS, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Society. It is normally diagnosed in people between the ages of 20 and 40. Symptoms might include fatigue, vision problems and difficulties with walking, but MS is different for everyone. In MS, the protective layer surrounding nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord - known as myelin - becomes damaged. The immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin, causing scarring or sclerosis. The damaged myelin disrupts the nerve signals - rather like the short circuit caused by a frayed electrical cable. If the process of inflammation and scarring is not treated, then eventually the condition can cause permanent neurodegeneration.

It says the Blue Nile will be slightly diverted but will then be able to follow its natural course. \"Egypt's water security cannot be violated at all,\" Mr Morsi said on Monday. \"As president of the state, I confirm to you that all options are open.\" \"If Egypt is the Nile's gift, then the Nile is a gift to Egypt,'' he said, quoting popular sayings about the river in an emotive televised speech. \"The lives of the Egyptians are connected around it... as one great people. If it diminishes by one drop then our blood is the alternative.\" Analysts say Mr Morsi could be using the issue to distract attention from severe domestic political and economic challenges. Egypt is particularly dependant on water supply from the Nile, and its growing population has been placing that supply under increasing strain. Sudan is also reliant on Nile waters. Egypt cites a colonial era ruling to claim a right to the majority of the Nile's waters for itself and Sudan, but Ethiopia says the ruling is outdated. Mr Morsi said Egypt had no objection to development projects on Nile basin states, \"but on condition that those projects do not affect or damage Egypt's legal and historical rights\". Last week, Egyptian politicians were inadvertently heard on live TV proposing military action over the dam.\n",

It also said that in a minority of experiments, the justification for using monkeys was \"not compelling\". The review was led by Professor Sir Patrick Bateson. The current president of the Zoological Society of London was commissioned by the main bodies that fund medical research in Britain. They wanted him to assess whether the studies on non-human primates (NHPs) were necessary, high-quality and yielded significant advances in medical science. Animal welfare groups opposed to experimentation on monkeys called again for the practice to be banned outright. They described Prof Bateson's review a \"chilling insight into primate research\". Although the proportion of monkeys used in research compared with other animals is low, less than 0.1%, there is concern that they suffer more than other species during experimentation, and so should only be used if those studies are expected to yield important medical benefits and if there is no other way of carrying out the research. The review suggested that this standard might not have been achieved in all cases. \"Not everything is rosy in the garden,\" Prof Bateson told reporters. He reviewed experiments on monkeys carried out between January 1997 and December 2006. Just under 3,000 animals were used in experiments in that period. The bulk of the research focused on neuroscience. Research on great apes is not permitted in the UK and so monkeys provide the next best animal models to study the human brain. Researchers often cite the widespread prevalence of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as a justification for research in this area. However, Prof Bateson said that the \"size of the problem should not be accepted as the sole justification for individual areas of research\". He added: \"Funders and researchers should avoid overstating and generalising the medical benefit (of research on monkeys). Instead, statements should be based on the actual scientific basis for funding decisions.\" Considerable suffering Prof Bateson and his team looked at 31 neuroscience studies. Half of the experiments involved considerable animal suffering. These were assessed as having a high scientific value. But in most cases, according to Prof Bateson, there was \"little direct evidence of medical benefit\". He did concede, though, that there might not have been sufficient time for the advances gained in scientific understanding to be\n",

The city council said rebuilding would be too expensive and the venue would be sold to a private company and could be knocked down and the site redeveloped. As well as live music, the Assembly Rooms also hosted British Open snooker. Perhaps its most famous musical moment was in 1983, when Morrissey was hit in the eye with a flower during a Smiths gig and fans invaded the stage at the end. The venue also hosted performances from acts such as The Clash, Paul Weller and Manic Street Preachers and was home to the city's pantomime each year. City council Labour leader Ranjit Banwait said he hoped the venue would be replaced with \"some kind of cultural offer\". The opposition Conservative group said the local authority had dithered over the plans. Councillor Robin Wood said the venue could have been kept \"alive\" in the interim until a bidder was found.

Lars Berglund said the driver's \"only intention was to avoid a crash\". Witnesses reported seeing the car going though red lights and barriers before the Warrington band's car plunged 80ft (24m) into a canal off a bridge, the middle section of which was raised. Mr Berglund told Mirror reporter Rhian Lubin: \"I have not suggested that [the driver] was doing this in order to kill himself or the band. I said he was making a move from the right lane to the left lane and that was not accidental. \"We can see the brake lights. His intention was to stop the car.

Whatever you think of DRS, which uses different types of technology to determine if a batsman should be given out, it's very good that it's now being standardised. Everybody should play with it or nobody plays with it. At least now it brings everybody into line to play cricket together under the same regulations. However, on pitches which are bound to suit the spinners - an area where India excel - and wear appreciably over the five days of a Test, I imagine the decision will help the Indians immensely. Playing spinners with DRS in place is an altogether different and more challenging prospect than without it and it will make India more difficult to beat for England. That's not the main point though: it's good India have joined in with what everyone else has been doing for a few years. India v England tour schedule That's an interesting question and many of the answers lie in the fact there has been a changing of the guard at the top of Indian cricket recently. That has brought about a much more open mind to these things. Their head coach Anil Kumble, who was opposed to the DRS system to begin with, has now changed his view. With a number of new players coming into the side, he's been able to show that it might possibly be the right thing for his side. Beforehand, batsmen like Sachin Tendulkar, for instance, were opposed to it. They felt the opposition would always keep a review up their sleeve especially for them because they were such key players. Ultimately, however, it's as simple as a change of attitude within the administration of the Indian cricket team which has led to this decision. Once we get onto the pitch, I think India, under their innovative new captain Virat Kohli, will use it well. Spin bowlers tend to have more success on the turning pitches of the subcontinent, and India have the world's number one bowler - off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin - in their ranks. England's batsmen must be careful how they play the spinning ball. For instance, you can't\n",

But more than £100bn of extra borrowing, roughly equivalent to the entire NHS budget - nearly £60bn of that the costs of Brexit - make a brutal backdrop for Theresa May's government as it only just gets going. Remember all the figures ought to be taken with a giant pinch of salt. Forecasts like these have so often been wrong. And no one is forecasting a recession. But what the chancellor said today and the Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated have big implications. First off, with the goal of balancing the books now an aspiration to be met as \"early as possible\", next Parliament, the Tories will be going into the next election, a decade after they took charge, without having kept the central promise they made 10 years before of clearing the deficit. Yes, you read that right - a full decade. As political promises go, that is a less than glorious record. Voters will see the national debt hitting 90% of GDP, not shy of £2 trillion, 10 years after being told that tough spending cuts were worth it, because within five years we would be on our way back to the mythic sunlit uplands. There is a separate debate about whether that was ever achievable, and how much Brexit can be blamed for the fact Mr Hammond has pushed those targets back again. But at the very least, it means the Conservatives will still be borrowing, and borrowing significantly, busting their own timetable by at least five years. And with wages predicted to slow, and inflation expected to rise, the public will feel the pinch too. Simply, if today's forecasts are right, the government's finances are set to be shaky for a lot longer, and more voters will feel skint. Despite Theresa May's repeated desire to help families who are finding it hard to make ends meet, there were few measures that will make a big difference. Privately, Treasury sources acknowledge they haven't done that much, despite Number 10's hopes. The truth is that they didn't have much cash to play with. And Mr Hammond's ambitions to rebuild the fundamentals of the economy were clearly his priority, rather than major concessions to help some groups of voters feel a bit more flush\n",

At least 24 cadets were reported to have been left unconscious because pillows were stuffed with hard objects. West Point Superintendent Lt Gen Robert L Caslen said the academy was pursuing unspecified disciplinary measures against those involved in the fights. He was quoted in the New York Times as saying that those facing such measures included \"senior military members and cadets alike\". Gen Caslen was not reported to have identified or provided the ranks of those who may be punished, but said he was determined \"to send a clear message that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated\". An army investigation dated the pillow fights to 2001, but congressional testimony reported in the New York Times suggests they date back more than a century. One cadet suffered a broken nose in the August pillow fight, while others had dislocated shoulders. West Point academy argued at the time the fight was designed to build \"esprit de corps\". None of the injuries was severe and all cadets have returned to duty, it said. Video of the fight posted online shows crowds of yelling cadets, some wearing body armour as well as helmets, surging together in a central quad. The annual night-time event has been described as a harmless way of blowing off steam at the end of a gruelling summer of training. But this year's event seems to have been a little over-exuberant, with pillow cases reported to have been stuffed with hard objects, thought to have been helmets.

Mark Dias and Steve Matthews claim they were targeted after challenging misconduct by fellow officers. The decision over whether the force's covert techniques used against its former employees were lawful will be made in the new year, following an Investigatory Powers Tribunal. At the hearing in London, Judge Sir Michael Burton said although he reserved judgement until 2017, it was clear what his decision would be. He said the force should start thinking about compensation for the two officers. Cleveland Police claimed it was justified in using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) - which has since been replaced. In a four-month period the force monitored over a million minutes of telephone data, the tribunal heard. Mr Matthews, the former head of Cleveland's Police Federation, said: \"I honestly think they were trying to stitch me up.\" If anyone criticised the force \"they would be jumped on and, as part of that campaign, I was singled out\", he said.

The Old Bailey heard a witness saw the cyclist fly \"through the air\". Mr Alliston, now 20, denies manslaughter and causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving. In court, prosecutor Duncan Penny QC read a statement from eyewitness David Callan who said he was walking in Old Street at about 12:15 BST when he heard a male voice calling. \"It made me look up immediately, just in time to see a collision between a cyclist and a pedestrian,\" he said. Mr Callan said the crash caused the cyclist to fly \"through the air\" while the pedestrian \"fell at the point of impact\". \"The cyclist clattered to the ground further down the road but quickly sprang to their feet and shouted something at the pedestrian... who lay on the ground,\" the court was told. Mark Wyeth QC, defending, suggested his client had the right of way as the lights on the stretch of Old Street were green. He added that Mrs Briggs could have avoided danger by using a pedestrian crossing less than 10 metres away. Jurors heard the 44-year-old HR consultant suffered \"non-survivable brain injuries\" and died in hospital a week later. They were previously told Mr Alliston was using a bike which which had no front brake so was not legal to use on the road. The court has been told crash investigators had concluded Mr Alliston would have been able to stop and avoid the impact if the bike had been fitted with two brakes. The trial continues.\n",

Anthony Andreu squared the tie 10 seconds from the end of stoppage time. Neither side managed to score in extra time, but Hibs' Kevin Thomson and Jason Cummings both had penalties saved. It was goals from teenager Cummings that had given Terry Butcher's side a 2-0 advantage over the Championship runners-up after the first leg at New Douglas Park.

            "Input: summarize: Now it's been announced that Bryan Cranston is to make his UK stage debut in an adaptation of the 1970s Oscar-winning film Network. The 60-year-old US actor will play Howard Beale, a TV news anchor who announces he will kill himself on air after he's told he's being sacked for declining ratings. In a famous scene, Beale implores his viewers during an on-air meltdown to shout out of the window: \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more!\" Adapted by Billy Elliot writer Lee Hall, Network will open on the National Theatre's Lyttelton stage in November. It will be directed by Ivo van Hove, whose Hedda Gabler at the NT is currently a sell-out hit. Announcing its new season on Friday, National Theatre boss Rufus Norris described Network as \"one of the greatest media satires of all time\". \"It's incredibly prescient in terms of the world today,\" he said. \"I think it will stand up in our digital world.\" The 1976 film, directed by Sidney Lumet, won four of its 10 Oscar nominations. Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway and Beatrice Straight cleaned up in three of the four acting categories while writer Paddy Chayefsky won for original screenplay. Norris said van Hove had been talking about the idea with Cranston for \"a couple of years\". \"He's got a fantastic pedigree as a stage actor,\" he said. \"It's a part that requires something compelling and special.\" Norris pointed out that Beale's \"mad as hell\" line was still being quoted at demonstrations - and had appeared on a placard held by singer Charlotte Church at a rally in 2015. Cranston won a Tony award in 2014 for his Broadway debut in Robert Schenkkan's play All the Way. He was Oscar nominated last year for Trumbo.

Speaking in the assembly, Mr Farry said that Northern Ireland was the only part of the UK actively \"disinvesting\" in higher education. The consultation process will involve a number of events and online presentations in order to seek opinion from students, university staff, unions and the wider public. Just under 40% of funding for Queen's University, Belfast (QUB) and Ulster University comes directly from Stormont's Department for Employment and Learning (DEL). However, the universities faced cuts of more than £16m in funding from DEL in 2015/16, which followed cuts in funding during previous years. Ulster University is shedding about 200 jobs in 2015/16 and 1,200 student places over the next three years, while Queen's University announced in April that it was cutting 236 jobs in 2015/16 and 1,010 student places over the next three years. Ulster University also closed a number of courses and departments including their School of Modern Languages at Coleraine, County Londonderry. The universities also draw about 30% of their annual funding from student tuition fees, which are currently £3,805 per year for students from Northern Ireland. Some students also study for degrees at further education colleges, and that budget was also reduced this year by about £12m. DEL's budget was reduced by £62m earlier this year, and its budget for higher education institutions fell from £203m to £186m, a reduction of 8.2%. Mr Farry said that, given its importance to the local economy and the fact that just under half of young people in Northern Ireland entered higher education, the status quo was no longer an option. During subsequent questions, a number of MLAs including Phil Flanagan of Sinn Féin, Jim Allister of the Tradition Unionist Voice (TUV) and Basil McCrea of NI21, expressed concern about a possible rise in tuition fees. In response, Mr Farry said that he had an \"open mind\" and that \"this is not a conversation about whether we have fees or don't have fees\". \"All options have to be on the table and fees are only one of many options facing us. This is not a done deal process.\" The consultation ends on 23 October, and Mr Farry said\n",

            "Input: summarize: Two communities are claiming compensation and want Shell to clean up their land. Shell said it is at an \"early stage\" in reviewing the claims and that the case should be heard in Nigeria. The Ogale community of about 40,000 people in Rivers State, on the coast of Nigeria, who are mainly farmers or fishermen, are some of the claimants. Their case is being handled by law firm Leigh Day. Spills since 1989 have meant they don't have clean drinking water, farmland or rivers, their claim says. It points to a November 2015 report by Amnesty International which says four spill sites Shell says it planned to clean up are still contaminated. The first court hearing at the Technology and Construction Court, held on Wednesday, found that the claimants can can lodge a case against Shell's Nigerian business, known as Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC). Shell declined to comment on the ruling. Amnesty's findings followed a 2011 report by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which found water contaminated with oil by-products including benzene, thought to be a carcinogen. It suggested a clean up, but said a \"sustainable recovery\" of the area could take up to 30 years. Shell says it has agreed a clean-up plan. \"In mid-2015 SPDC JV, along with the government, UNEP and representatives of the Ogoni community, agreed to an 18-month roadmap to fast-track the environmental clean-up and remediation of Ogoniland which includes a governance framework,\" it said in a statement. The Bille community, who are mainly fishermen and are the other party to sue, claims Shell should be liable for \"failing to protect their pipelines from damage caused by third parties\", according to Leigh Day. Pipelines in the area have been targets for thieves who steal crude oil and try to refine it locally. This has lead to more spills and damage though explosions. \"Both Bille and Ogale are areas heavily impacted by crude oil theft, pipeline sabotage and illegal refining which remain the main sources of pollution across the Niger Delta. \"Ogale is in Ogoniland and it is important to note that SPDC has produced no oil or gas in Ogoniland since 1993.

I was always sure what supplements and medicines I was using.\" Earlier this month, the International Olympic Committee said up to 31 athletes from around the world could be banned from the Rio Olympics as a result of the retests, which were conducted using the latest scientific methods. The Russian Olympic Committee subsequently revealed that 14 of those 31 athletes were Russian. A Russian TV report then claimed those 14 athletes included 10 medallists, among them 33-year-old Chicherova, who is planning to defend her Olympic title at the Rio Games, which begin on 5 August.

Some Jewish students in the UK say growing support for BDS has fuelled a rise in anti-Semitism on campuses. The Commission said it would assess the concerns and take action if necessary. The BDS - which stands for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions - describes itself as a human rights organisation and criticises Israel for its human rights record. It says it stands for \"freedom, justice and equality\", saying it is \"inclusive and categorically opposes as a matter of principle all forms of racism\" - including anti-Semitism. Devora Khafi, a student at Queen Mary University of London, is one of nearly 10,000 Jewish students in the UK. She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she felt physically intimidated when other students hijacked a speech at London's UCL given by a former Israeli defence force officer. She said she was pushed against some doors, jostled and shouted at by protesters. She says she fears having a connection with Israel has made other people at her university hostile towards her. \"If I ever express a viewpoint in class or on social media, I get comments, in public or private,\" she said. \"It has been hard. It's been two years of constant fighting for our freedom of speech, our rights, our wellbeing. I've missed deadlines, I've had counselling, I've had anxiety episodes,\" she said. Devora believes the BDS movement is adding to a climate of hostility against Israel on campus, which she says has turned her and other Jewish students into scapegoats. \"If you look behind the BDS lens, it calls for these things that are not peaceful. They harm Jewish students and pro-Israel students and they don't support a peaceful, atmosphere on campus.\" Support for BDS has been growing rapidly on British campuses. London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) students' union in London was one of the first to endorse the BDS, after students voted in favour in a referendum in 2015. The students' union implemented an academic boycott of Israel. The BBC found 17 students' unions have now passed motions\n",

As Voges, James Franklin and John Simpson fell to the new ball, it left them on 215-8 and Hampshire in hope of a win, with the lead at just 133. But the Middlesex tail held on and hands were shaken on a draw after tea. Middlesex were the only side to remain unbeaten over the entire 2016 season as they claimed their first title since 1993, but they looked in danger of beginning a new campaign with a loss when they got under way. Without the injured Fidel Edwards, Abbott - who took his total to 16 Division One wickets in two matches - led Hampshire's attack, with Brad Wheal (3-73) also contributing. Voges survived an lbw appeal on 29 before nightwatchman Steven Finn (16) was caught off a Wheal bouncer, but Simpson joined the former Australia Test batsman to stop any Hampshire momentum. However, with the new ball in hand, Abbott gave the hosts a glimmer of hope, having Voges caught behind and Franklin taken in the slips before Gareth Berg snared Simpson (22) for wicket-keeper Lewis McManus' fourth catch. It wasn't to be for Hampshire though as Toby Roland-Jones (25), Ollie Rayner (17 not out) and Tim Murtagh (19 not out) took Middlesex to a lead of 196 and safety at tea. Michael Carberry and Jimmy Adams were brought on to bowl, signalling their intentions to agree on a draw, which brought both sides 10 points and moved Hampshire into second place in Division One behind Surrey. Hampshire captain James Vince told BBC Radio Solent: \"The way the guys fought back from Middlesex being 220-2 in their first innings to get into a position where we were really close to being able to chase a gettable score on that wicket is an incredible effort from everyone. \"The bowlers, having lost Fidel early in the first innings, were outstanding to put in a shift to get us into that position. \"We did exactly what we wanted with the new ball and came within one wicket of probably setting up a 150-run chase in 40-od\n",

Under the hashtag #RIPTwitter, thousands, perhaps millions, told the world that this was the end of civilisation as we know it, that a beautiful thing was being crushed, that the company, whose share price has been tumbling for months, was signing its own death warrant. Finally, the CEO Jack Dorsey was forced to react. \"Hello Twitter!\" he called out. \"Regarding #RIPTwitter: I want you all to know we're always listening. We never planned to reorder timelines next week.\" He went on \"Twitter is live. Twitter is real-time. Twitter is about who & what you follow. And Twitter is here to stay! By becoming more Twitter-y.\" But was Dorsey right to blink in the face of pressure? And should he be \"always listening\" to his users? That depends on whether you believe the hoariest old cliche of management books: \"The customer is always right.\" I certainly sympathise with those who say that Twitter isn't broken, so it does not need the kind of radical fixing implied by an algorithmic timeline. For me, it works just fine, connecting me to like-minded communities of dog-owners, sourdough loaf bakers, and gadget enthusiasts, while providing the best breaking news service on the planet. Like many other heavy users of Twitter, I have been sniffy about recent innovations such as \"Moments\" and would rather things carried on just as they are. But perhaps Mr Dorsey and his management team should not be listening to people like me - we're almost certainly going nowhere. He has to cock an ear to the concerns of three other constituencies - investors, advertisers and the people who use Twitter infrequently or not at all.

But, intensive care expert Dr Jasmeet Soar said he had not found \"a medical explanation for that\". He said Kevin's heart was likely to have stopped after 15:30 following an unsuccessful resuscitation attempt. The teenager was one of 96 people who died following a crush at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989. Kevin's mother Anne campaigned for more than 20 years for a new inquest into his death, but died before the current hearings began. Dr Stefan Popper, the coroner who oversaw the original Hillsborough inquests in the early 1990s, ruled all those who died had suffered fatal injuries by 15:15. As such, he said, he did not need to hear evidence on any events after that time. It was, according to the current coroner Sir John Goldring, a \"highly controversial decision\", which the bereaved families \"strongly disputed\". The new jurors have heard how the 15:15 cut-off meant the first inquests did not look into whether the police, ambulance service and others handled the aftermath of the disaster properly. They have now heard evidence that some of the 96 may have been alive after 15:15, with one expert witness saying there was a \"strong possibility\" Jimmy Hennessy was alive on the pitch between 15:15 and 15:20 that day. Dr Soar, an expert in intensive care medicine and resuscitation, was asked to give his opinion of what happened to Kevin based on the evidence heard about the teenager's movements. The jury saw how Kevin was carried out of pen three at 15:28, at which point Dr Soar said he was \"deeply unconscious\", \"unresponsive to stimulation\" and did not appear to have \"any body tone or muscle tone\", which was \"significant\" because it indicated he was not conscious.

He took office earlier this year promising to lead the country out of its worst recession in many decades. Protests against the measure turned violent in the capital Brasilia and at least a dozen states in the country. The opposition says the measures will mainly hit areas such as health and education, which are already underfunded. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets during the Senate session to protest against the austerity plan. After the vote, many demonstrations descended into violence. In Brasilia, masked protesters set fire to a bus and marched on the local offices of Globo TV, which they say is biased towards Mr Temer's government. But the marchers were blocked by riot police. In Sao Paulo, the headquarters of the state's conservative Industrial Federation (Fiesp) was attacked. To pass the constitutional amendment, the government needed the votes of 49 senators - three-fifths of the Senate. The measure was approved by a narrower margin than the government expected, passing by 53 to 19 votes. \"We have won. That was the main thing: to deliver the product in the middle of a storm,\" said government leader in the Senate Romero Juca. The project, known in Brazil as PEC 55, freezes expenditure in the executive, judiciary and legislative branches of power, allowing them to grow only by the rate of inflation n the previous year. The government argues it is necessary to boost growth and investments, and contain the country's growing public deficit. But critics say the poorest in society will be harmed and that setting a spending cap for two decades in advance is unrealistic, says the BBC's Julia Carneiro in Rio de Janeiro. The measure takes effect on Thursday.\n",

Eleven horses were caught by drug testing, while Al Zarooni admitted at Wednesday's hearing to doping four others.

The steady rise in value is believed to be linked to policy changes in Japan and China that have made it easier for speculators to trade in bitcoins. Many other virtual currencies have also enjoyed a sustained rise in value over the last few weeks. Bitcoin first broke the $1,000 (£768) barrier in November 2013 but its value has fluctuated wildly since then. For instance, in early 2014 one bitcoin was worth only $280 (£215). And at the end of 2016, each one was changing hands for about $900 (£690). Bitcoin emerged in 2008 and is a digital currency based around cryptography. Individual coins can be split into smaller denominations and many people involved with the currency use computers to verify the globally-held log, known as the blockchain, of who spent what where. Verifying transactions involves solving a complicated mathematical problem and the first person to do so gets rewarded with bitcoins. Rising interest in bitcoin has sparked the creation of many other crypto-currencies. These have proved popular as the technology underlying bitcoin has struggled to cope with its popularity and growth. One estimate suggests bitcoins now make up only 47% of all traded crypto-currencies. Rivals such as Ethereum and Ripple have been gaining value far faster than bitcoin over the last few months. The surging valuations has led some commentators to suggest that an unsustainable crypto-currency bubble is developing. \"The question is not if but when the market will turn,\" said an editorial in The Economist.\n",

The Holyland is a residential part of south Belfast popular with students. Employment and Learning Minister Stephen Farry is to meet residents' representatives on Monday afternoon. Eleven people were arrested in the area and the city centre over the St Patrick's Day period. One policeman was injured when bottles were thrown at officers in Agincourt Avenue. A number of vehicles were also damaged and residents complained about excessive noise and litter in their streets. There has been a history of trouble in the Holyland on previous St Patrick's Days and talks have been held before in a bid to prevent students engaging in anti-social behaviour. The chairman of the Holyland Regeneration Association, Ray Farley, said the existing measures had not worked and called for Stormont ministers to intervene. Speaking last Friday ahead of the meeting, Mr Farry said he was \"appalled\" by the behaviour of some young people in the area but said the majority of them were not university or college students.

But researchers say there is a \"reality gap\" between safeguards designed to help affected communities and who actually receives the compensation. The findings have been published online in Global Environment Change. \"About 11% of global emissions come from deforestation and degradation of tropical forests so the idea is that if you can slow this down then that can offset emissions and that is good for climate mitigation,\" explained Julia Jones from Bangor University, Wales. Over the past decade, schemes called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (Redd/Redd+) have been developed as part of the global effort to mitigate climate change. These mechanisms are designed to improve forest management and reduce the net emission of greenhouse gases in tropical forest and sub-tropical forest nations. \"It finally got approval (at the UN climate summit) in Paris in December that Redd+ will go ahead as a global climate mitigation mechanism,\" Prof Jones told BBC News. \"What that means in reality is more protected areas and more funding. This sounds brilliant, after all it is a win-win situation and what is there not to like about it?\" However, it has been widely acknowledged that such schemes - if not implemented properly - can have a significant negative impact on people's livelihoods, such as indigenous communities, and exacerbate poverty. \"This has been taken on board by, for example, the World Bank,\" observed Prof Jones. \"They have made commitments that anything they fund [and] people are displaced as a result, they must be compensated for it. \"These commitments are also encapsulated in other doctrines, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity.\" But she added: \"The problem is how do you go about doing that? The way that the World Bank guidelines work is that households affected by a scheme must be identified and then compensated for the negative impact of the establishment of a protected area on their livelihoods.\" In order to test whether the commitment to \"social safeguards\" were working on the ground, the team of UK and Madagascan researchers looked in detail at an area within Madagascar where a new protected area was being established. The work was being funded by the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility. \"We have shown that, yes, they have gone out\n",

            "Input: summarize: Robert Norman, 54, is charged with misconduct in a public office while working at Belmarsh, a top-security prison in south-east London. He was allegedly paid more than £10,000 for 40 tips to reporter Stephen Moyes between 30 April 2006 and 1 May 2011. Mr Norman, of Swanscombe, Kent, denies the charge against him. Opening the case at the Old Bailey, prosecutor Julian Christopher QC said Mr Norman was an \"extremely experienced\" prison officer and a member of the Prison Officers Association, acting as union representative to colleagues. The court heard Mr Norman first phoned the Daily Mirror in 2006 and gave Mr Moyes a story about staff cuts at the prison, for which he was paid £400. The exclusive story described Belmarsh as a \"terror prison\" and ran alongside a photograph of one of its most notorious prisoners, radical preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri, the court heard. As the relationship developed, it became a \"two-way affair\" and Mr Norman carried on dealing with Mr Moyes when the journalist moved to the News of the World, the court heard. Mr Christopher said: \"Sometimes Robert Norman would approach Stephen Moyes with something he thought would be of interest, at other times Stephen Moyes would approach Robert Norman for inside information about a topic in which he was interested, or for confirmation which he would not be able to get for free from the official channels at the Ministry of Justice press office. \"Effectively, Robert Norman became the journalist's paid mole within HMP Belmarsh.\" The court heard that when Mr Norman was arrested in 2013 he maintained he had acted in the public interest as a whistleblower. Cheques for the stories were made out to Mr Norman's son Daniel and the money was then transferred into Mr Norman's account, showing he was \"worried about the trouble he would get into\" if found out, Mr Christopher said.

It's not hard to see why. Nostalgia is part of it, these being the remnants of a once great and noble industry, around which large parts of Lanarkshire was built. It's partly because Clydebridge and Dalzell are symbolic of the impact of globalisation, forcing transition on workers and communities at a local level as the price of enriching the broader economy. Other parts of Britain and Europe feel the strain of in-migrating people. In Motherwell and Cambuslang, the concern is about out-migrating jobs. But it's also because there's discomfort that the new economy and the new labour market is unplanned and haphazard, buffeted by market forces and lacking in the security of big plants with jobs-for-life. It is not always easy to appreciate that Britain has grown quite successfully in recent years by retreating from the making of things. The service sector makes up 75% of the economy, and while it ranges from high-value finance and professional roles to burger-flipping and care homes, it lacks that noble quality with which the old heavy (and dirty) industries are seen in hindsight. There is widespread agreement that Britain needs to think again about manufacturing. On the freer market end of things, George Osborne coined the evocative ambition for there to be a \"march of the makers\". The rhetoric hasn't always matched the policy outcomes. Industrial policy at Westminster now consists of a push towards a more technically literate workforce, and incentives aimed at 11 chosen sectors, ranging across aerospace and automotive to nuclear and wind power, life sciences and professional and business services. There are also 'catapult centres' for propelling ideas towards the market in robotics, synthetic biology and better batteries. If you want to see what British manufacturing looks like these days (under German management and with a lot of robots), I'd highly recommend 'Building Cars Live' on the BBC iPlayer for two more weeks.

The US says Belmokhtar was targeted and the strike was successful, but it is assessing the operation's results and would give details \"as appropriate\". Mokhtar Belmokhtar's death has been reported many times in the past. Born in Algeria, Belmokhtar was a former senior figure in al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), but left to form his own militia. He gained notoriety with the attack on the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria in 2013, when about 800 people were taken hostage and 40 killed, most of them foreigners, including six Britons and three Americans. The US has filed terror charges against him and officials said they believed he remained a threat to Western interests. \"Belmokhtar has a long history of leading terrorist activities as a member of AQIM, is the operational leader of the al-Qaeda-associated al-Murabitoun organisation in north-west Africa, and maintains his personal allegiance to al-Qaeda,\" said Pentagon spokesman Col Steve Warren. The Libyan government said the strike came after consultation with the US. Their statement said it resulted in the death of the \"terrorist Belmokhtar\". Libya has been in chaos since the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Its internationally recognised parliament is operating in exile in the eastern port of Tobruk.

An investigation by the newspaper found major brands were appearing next to YouTube videos promoting extremist views - generating revenues for the creators. The company has apologised and promised better tools for advertisers. Despite Google’s efforts to contain the row, which began in the UK earlier this week, it appears to have now caught the attention of the US advertising industry - creating a huge problem for Google as it seeks to reassure brands their ad spend is not funding hate groups. According to The Times, Verizon’s advertisements were appearing along side videos made by Wagdi Ghoneim, an Egyptian cleric who had been banned from the US over extremism, and Hanif Qureshi, whose teachings inspired the assassination of a Pakistani politician. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” AT&T said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” The UK-based investigation led more than 250 brands to pull their advertising. In a blog post published on Monday, Google’s chief business officer Philipp Schindler announced the company was expanding its policies on hate speech to include videos targeting vulnerable groups. In response to the latest boycott from the US brands, Google said on Wednesday: “We’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear.” “We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” Google is the dominant player in online advertising, and ads are by far the company’s biggest source of money. In 2016, the firm generated $80bn in ad revenue - accounting for almost 90% of the firm’s total income for the year. Of the boycotts announced on Wednesday, both Verizon and AT&T have major online advertising ambitions of their own.

Growth of the trees is still restricted more than 30 years later, a study in the journal Functional Ecology said. The more drought-tolerant Sessile Oak survived better and is now dominating the beech. The scientific work was carried out at Lady Wood Park in the Wye Valley. This 45 hectare (111 acre) site is a national nature reserve and is attractive to researchers because it has been deliberately unmanaged since 1945. Detailed forest surveys have been carried out in the park over the past 70 years and the ecologists were able to use these along with tree ring data to discover how the different tree species fared over the period. Before 1976, beech was the dominant species in this area. But that summer's drought has permanently changed the makeup of the forest. That dry spell was the most exceptional drought in the years between 1914 and 2006 - it was 30% more intense than the next driest year, 1921. The researchers found that in the period immediately after 1976, there was a significant growth in beech mortality. Between 1977 and 1992, 17% of these trees died, while there were no deaths among the oaks. \"The beech growth dropped very suddenly,\" said Prof Alistair Jump from the University of Stirling who carried out the work along with researchers from Joint Nature Conservation Committee. \"The Sessile Oak which is slightly less competitive but is more drought tolerant took advantage and grew much better - and beech has never fully recovered in the system.\" The researchers say the oaks increased their growth rate by approximately 20% in the years immediately after 1976. The beech trees eventually stabilised their growth rate but only at around 75% of pre-drought levels. The scientists say that beech trees can appear to tolerate drought without a long term impact until a threshold is reached. \"I think tipping point is a key idea, and that's something that we see very clearly in the work,\" said Prof Jump. \"They are resistant up to a point and then we hit a tipping point and the system shows very severe impacts. The problem is we don't know where these tipping points are for other species.\" The researchers say they expect the changes that they recorded at Lady Park Wood\n",

At least 15 people are still missing after the avalanche that came after several earthquakes and heavy snowfall. While one more survivor has yet to be rescued, Italian media said other voices may have been heard in the ruins during the night. Five people have been confirmed dead. The first five survivors were taken to safety on Friday, some 40 hours after the avalanche hit on Wednesday. They had reportedly taken refuge beneath a collapsed portion of ceiling, where they were able to light a fire to keep warm for two days. The rescue has been hampered by deep snow blocking an access road. There are also concerns that further avalanches could follow, Italian newspaper La Stampa reported. The first person pulled out on Friday was an eight-year-old boy, the son of a holidaymaker, Giampiero Parete, who had gone to his car when the avalanche struck and first sounded the alarm by calling his boss. The boy's mother, Adriana, was pulled out next, telling rescue workers her six-year-old daughter was still trapped inside. The little girl was also later saved and the family was reunited at a hospital in the coastal town of Pescara. Hospital officials told the Associated Press news agency they had symptoms of hypothermia and dehydration, but were otherwise in good health. Reports said all four children who survived did so because they were all playing in the same games room, that avoided the worst of the damage. The latest rescues, of two men and two women, took place at about 03:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Saturday. Wednesday's earthquakes included four stronger than magnitude 5, in a region already struggling with heavy snowfall that buried phone lines and took out power cables. Many of the guests had gathered on the ground floor of the hotel to await evacuation following the earthquakes. But the avalanche completely buried the hotel at about 17:00 (16:00 GMT) on Wednesday.

The Rainforest Alliance, an ethical certification organisation, has now stripped a group of Assam Company's plantations of its green frog seal. The Assam Company said it was appealing against the decision. A group of Assam Company's estates lost its certification because \"it was found to be in breach of critical criteria relating to the use of personal protective equipment\", the Rainforest Alliance said in a statement. The Assam Company said the loss of its certification was because of a \"minor error\" on one estate - Hajua - while spraying a plant extract, which it understood did not require personal protective equipment. It said that because the Assam company estates operate in a \"single cluster\", the other estates were automatically decertified. Twinings, Taylors of Harrogate and Fortnum & Mason have suspended business with the company while Harrods took the tea off its shelves shortly after the investigation, which was broadcast in September. Workers at the company's Hajua estate were seen spraying agrochemicals without the protective equipment employers are required to provide, when the BBC visited. Men spraying reported breathing difficulties, numbness of the hands and face, a burning sensation on the skin and profound loss of appetite. The Rainforest Alliance said its auditor confirmed the BBC's evidence of unsafe spraying and the organisation had tightened its rules on the subject. Taylors of Harrogate said it will maintain a relationship with the estates and support efforts to improve standards. Twinings plans to continue working with the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP) - an organisation set up by UK tea companies to improve workers' lives - to monitor the working and living conditions on all the tea estates from which it buys. It also plans to conduct a review of the Assam estates it sources from in the next few months. Because of the way ETP and the Rainforest Alliance work together, a Rainforest suspension automatically results in a suspension of ETP certification.

Together with 85 from skipper Alastair Cook, Bairstow's third ton in six Tests dragged the hosts out of a hole in near-perfect conditions for batting. Rash strokeplay mixed with disciplined bowling from Sri Lanka had reduced Cook's men to 84-4 just after lunch. But Bairstow profited from a dropped catch and then the most marginal of lbw decisions to continue his wonderful early summer run of form. Not since beating India 4-0 in the summer of 2011 have England whitewashed a Test opponent in a series of three or more matches. And while the weather forecast for the remainder of the match is uncertain, Bairstow's fightback has given them a hold in a contest that had been drifting Sri Lanka's way. Media playback is not supported on this device While England have improved both in style and substance over the course of the last year, serious flaws remain - and the vulnerability of the top order is the most pressing of all. On a true pitch and under benign skies, they once again lost key wickets cheaply - four this time for 28 runs, having chosen to bat and looked completely untroubled in the first hour of play. First Alex Hales lost patience, having been kept runless for 22 balls, heaving unnecessarily at Rangana Herath to send a looping edge to Angelo Mathews at slip. Then Nick Compton, mired in a horrible trot of form and seemingly bereft of confidence, chased a wide half-volley and edged Suranga Lakmal behind for just one. Joe Root followed four runs later, pinned lbw by the same bowler after the initial not-out decision was correctly overturned by the third umpire, and when James Vince had his bail removed by Nuwan Pradeep for 10 just after lunch, England had slumped from 56-0 to 84-4.

So what will Southgate take away from the last week as England look ahead to their next qualifier in Scotland on 10 June? Southgate set the normal rules about strikers and age aside to bring 34-year-old Jermain Defoe back into the England fold four years after his last goal for his country, scored in a victory against San Marino. Injuries to main striker Harry Kane and all-time record goalscorer Wayne Rooney forced Southgate's hand but he was able to call on the hard evidence provided by Defoe's 14 Premier League goals in a Sunderland side renowned for not making chances and rooted to the bottom of the table. Defoe has always traded in the game's most important currency, goals, throughout his lengthy career. This was a performance designed to demonstrate to doubters and Southgate he has not outlived his usefulness at international level. He was sharp and saw one chance saved before he demonstrated his poacher's instinct in the penalty area to slide in Adam Lallana's pass in the 21st minute before flashing another shot narrowly off target. In many respects he is an old-fashioned attacking operator in that his first thought is always the back of the net and shooting at it. No extra touches or passes are required. Defoe had two shots on target, one off target and one blocked with very limited opportunities - but most significantly made England's breakthrough. He is selfish in just the right way and in a World Cup qualifying group where England will be confronted by the sort of mass defence Lithuania presented here, it is unlikely this will be a temporary return to the colours. Dele Alli was given heavy-handed - or more precisely heavy-footed - treatment from Lithuania as they tried to light the short fuse that has brought Tottenham's 20-year-old some unsavoury headlines in his short career. It meant Alli was nowhere near as influential as he was in Dortmund on Wednesday, where his efforts will have imprinted his importance for both the present and the future in Southgate's mind.

But the team behind the discovery has now come back with a deeper analysis. It tells Science magazine that features seen in the brain, feet, hands and pelvis of A. sediba all suggest this species was on the direct evolutionary line to us - Homo sapiens. \"We have examined the critical areas of anatomy that have been used consistently for identifying the uniqueness of human beings,\" said Professor Lee Berger from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg \"Any one of these features could have evolved separately, but it is highly unlikely that all of them would have evolved together if A. sediba was not related to our lineage,\" the team leader informed BBC News. It is a big claim and, if correct, would sideline other candidates in the fossil record for which similar assertions have been made in the past. Theory holds that modern humans can trace a line back to a creature known as Homo erectus which lived more than a million years ago. This animal, according to many palaeoanthropologists, may in turn have had its origins in more primitive hominins, as they are known, such as Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. The contention now made for A. sediba is that, although older than its \"rivals\", some of its anatomy and capabilities were more advanced than these younger forms. Put simply, it is a more credible ancestor for H. erectus, Berger's team claims. The sediba specimens were unearthed at Malapa in the famous Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site, just to the northwest of Jo'burg. They were pulled from a pit - a depression left in the ground by a cave complex that had lost its roof through erosion over time. Identified as an adult female and a juvenile male, the two individuals were quite possibly mother and son. What seems certain is that they died together in some tragic accident that saw them either fall into the cave complex or become stuck in it.

And if you stand inside the tiny cell where South Africa's struggle icon spent 18 years hidden from the world, and peer through the barred window into the high-walled courtyard, you can just make out the thin strip of green and brown foliage where he once tended tomatoes and chillies. \"A garden was one of the few things in prison that one could controlâ€ The sense of being the custodian of this small patch of earth offered a small taste of freedom,\" Mr Mandela wrote in his autobiography, Long Walk To Freedom - an early draft of which, incidentally, he tried to hide from the prison guards by burying in the garden. Today, the garden's weeds - and the rotting stump of an apple tree - hint at the alleged mismanagement and corruption that have blighted Robben Island for years.

            "Input: summarize: Pro-democracy activists have staged huge protests, the most recent on the 1 July anniversary of the day Hong Kong was handed back to China from Britain. They have threatened to occupy parts of the city if their demands are not met. Public discontent in Hong Kong is at its highest for years with concern over Beijing's influence over elections. The city's police estimated Sunday's turnout at more than 110,000 people, but a specialist polling group based at the University of Hong Kong put the figure at around 80,000. \"We want to let the world know that we want peace, we want democracy, but please, do not threaten us, do not try to turn this place into a place of violence,\" Robert Chow, co-founder of the pro-government Alliance for Peace and Democracy told AFP. Political rallies are a common sight in Hong Kong, a special Chinese city with a high level of freedom. But large-scale demonstrations supportive of the Chinese government in Beijing are extremely rare. The demonstrators -- much older than their pro-democracy rivals and clearly mobilised by dozens of pro-China clan organisations -- carried signs opposing the civil disobedience movement called Occupy Central. Questions have been raised about the legitimacy of the demonstration. Hong Kong media reports have suggested some companies and business groups had asked their employees to take part. Despite those controversies, Johnson Yeung, a pro-democracy activist who organised the recent 1 July protest, told BBC News the rally was indeed an historic event. \"For the first time since the handover in 1997, the central government has organised a mass rally of this scale. It really shows their commitment against Occupy Central.\" The large turnout is a reminder there is still no consensus in the battle for Hong Kong's political future. In the other camp, pro-democracy activists from the \"Occupy Central\" group have said they would mobilise protesters to take over some of the busier areas of the central business district if electoral reform is not put in place. City authorities say such an occupation would be illegal however, and argue that it could tarnish Hong Kong's reputation. Hong Kong's next elections will take place in 2017, and China says it will introduce universal suffrage for the vote. However\n",

Frampton wants to defend the title in his home city of Belfast and did not rule out a rematch, although he also has Selby in his sights. \"He's mentioned me a few times, sounds like he wants the fight,\" Selby said. \"I want the fight and it shouldn't be too difficult to make.\" Selby said any possible meeting could be held in Belfast or Cardiff's Principality Stadium. Barry-born Selby insisted before the fight there was no chance of him meeting British rival Josh Warrington, who beat Patrick Hyland to retain his WBC International featherweight title. Selby accused Warrington of 'running scared,' after talks fell through over arranging a summer contest at Leeds' Elland Road. Frampton inflicted the first defeat of 27-year-old Mexican Santa Cruz's career to become the first Northern Ireland fighter to win a world title in two weight divisions. It was Frampton's first pro bout at featherweight, having moved up a division after unifying the IBF and WBA super-bantamweight titles by beating England's Scott Quigg in Manchester in February. Selby said he was not surprised by Frampton's majority verdict over Santa Cruz, who has held world titles at three weights. \"I thought it was a brilliant fight and very competitive from the first bell to the last,\" Selby added. \"Carl Frampton boxed excellent and he surprised me with his tactics. I thought he would box on the back foot and use his range and jab. \"But at times he held his feet, stood in the middle of the ring and went toe to toe and beat Santa Cruz at his own game.\"\n",

He died on Tuesday surrounded by his family in hospital, his publicist said. His wife Camilla said she was \"deeply grateful\" to staff who cared for him. The father-of-three, who was in intensive care at Cork University Hospital, \"died peacefully\" with his family at his side \"who were singing him on his way\", a statement said. \"Colin received the best possible care from the expert and highly professional staff there and we are deeply grateful for everything they did,\" his wife and three sons said in a statement.

However, despite having found fame, Vearncombe later said \"the pop star life\" was not as he had imagined it. \"I was frustrated by how few of the people in the music world I respected. Maybe I just didn't go to the right clubs.

            "Input: summarize: It said the investigation following complaints from price comparison websites had failed to understand the \"reality\" of online shopping. It blamed a drop in traffic for price comparison sites on Amazon and others. Europe's competition commissioner first accused the firm of abusing its dominance in search in April 2015 and made further claims in July 2016. Google's shopping results appear as a box of images and links displayed alongside other search results. In 2015, the EU competition commissioner claimed these results gave prominence to Google's own services and advertisements, to the detriment of price comparison websites, which may have lost visitors. Google responded that the EU had failed to take into account the significance of online shopping giants such as Amazon, which it said also competed against price comparison websites. In its updated claim, the EU said Amazon could not be considered a rival to price comparison websites because it sometimes paid such sites to be included in search results. Google's latest response says websites such as Amazon get a \"tiny fraction\" of their visitors from price comparison websites, \"hardly enough to support the idea that they don't compete\" with one another. It also pointed out that Amazon provides its own price comparison tools for its customers. \"The commission's revised case still rests on a theory that just doesn't fit the reality of how most people shop online,\" the company said in a blog. \"It's not surprising that when Amazon and other new competitors arrived in European countries, traffic to sites offering only price comparison went down.\" The company said it would \"look forward\" to continuing discussions with the commission. FairSearch Europe - a lobby group that was one of the complainants against Google - said Google's actions were \"anti-consumer\". In a statement, the group said: \"We believe it is the European Commission that has the interests of consumers in mind, not a private company that makes money by using its market power to charge high prices to advertisers. \"When consumers look at Google ads they do not get the best, most relevant results. Instead, they get results from advertisers willing to pay Google the most money.\"\n",

But I was there to make a documentary about Europe dancing to a worrying tune - popular discontent, fear, anger and, in many corners, an absence of hope. There is always a section in society that feels abandoned or ignored by their government, but after the 2008 crash, the bank bailouts, the migrant crises and a string of terror attacks, a growing number of Europeans have felt unprotected, exposed and worried for the future of their families. And the answer to their fears? Well if my Fiat 500 were Europe - bear with me on this one - it would be hesitating at a crossroads. The signpost pointing one way reads Angela Merkel. And in the opposite direction, Marine Le Pen. These two determined women, tough and seasoned politicians, both standing for election this year, hope to drag their own countries and Europe as a whole down dramatically different paths. A passionate European and Christian Democrat, mindful of the horrors of her country's Nazi and Cold War past, Ms Merkel is increasingly viewed as the continent's number one defender of liberal values. Barack Obama pointedly chose to visit her in Berlin on his last official trip abroad before handing over the presidency to Donald Trump. Ms Le Pen, on the other hand, is the poster child of Europe's new wave of populism. She demands what she described to me in an interview as a \"new world order\". A new France, a new Europe, free, she says, of the \"prison\" of the European Union and the \"artificial\" joining of European nations. She laughed at those wringing their hands on both sides of the Atlantic over the Trump Presidency. Brexit, Trump and Europe's new \"patriotic leaders\" in Ms Le Pen's words, are merely the end of one world and the start of a new one where, in her opinion, the people and the nation state are strong and don't answer to what she called \"Globalisationists\". Gone are the days in the not so distant past when national elections met a wall of public indifference - 2017 has been dubbed 'Election Year' in Europe\n",

And then two years later, it struck gold again, finding yet another giant oil reserve. Optimism was running high. The firm went to the markets and raised over $70bn - the world's largest share issue ever. Brazil's economy was at cruising speed too, finally taking off after years of meagre growth. But the good times did not last long - for neither the company nor the country. A massive corruption scandal last year eroded much of Petrobras's market value. Brazil's economy too has been on a downward spiral - with high inflation, slow growth and low confidence. So how did it all go so wrong, so fast? Petrobras's oil bonanza and Brazil's emerging star status are fairly recent phenomena. Just a few decades ago, prospects were dire for both. In the early 1990s, Brazil was a young democracy in deep economic trouble. Annualised inflation was running close to 5,000%. Decades of protectionism meant there was little competition in most sectors and many national firms had become inefficient. Petrobras was seen as part of that landscape by many who wanted to privatise it. One critic used to refer to it as \"Petrossauro\" - a large, outdated structure that moved slowly and was doomed to extinction in the modern world. Brazil's fortunes started to change in the mid-1990s - both internally and externally. Through reforms, successive governments were able to defeat hyperinflation, open up Brazil's economy to the world and redistribute growth, lifting millions out of poverty. A decade of global economic boom favoured Brazil's champion exports - commodities like coffee, soya, beef and oil. Brazil's oil sector was opened to foreign companies, but local laws made sure Petrobras kept its role at the top of every major project. A decade of high international oil prices helped give a great boost to the firm's investment plans. By 2010 - after all oil discoveries - it felt like Brazil and Petrobras had finally \"arrived\" at the top. But then things took a turn for the worse. One problem was Petrobras\n",

It wants Italy to destroy infected trees and restrict any trade in species vulnerable to the disease. New emergency measures are to be proposed by the Commission this week. Thousands of hectares of olives are affected by the outbreak - a major worry for Italy, which is the EU's second biggest olive oil producer after Spain. The Commission set out a range of measures to contain the outbreak last July, but says the situation has deteriorated since then and more action is needed. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) says the disease, which kills trees by desiccation, is spread by various sap-sucking insects. An EFSA spokesperson told the BBC that there remain \"a lot of uncertainties\" about the Italian outbreak, despite a comprehensive EFSA study of it published in January. \"Even trees not showing symptoms might carry the bacteria, which makes it really difficult. Just cutting down trees with symptoms might not be enough,\" he said. Italian officials in Lecce say 15km-wide (nine-mile) buffer strips will be created around plantations which have infected trees. Those strips should be free of species vulnerable to the disease, so that the blight is contained. Local officials, quoted by Italy's AGI news agency, suspect the disease entered Italy through ornamental plants imported from Costa Rica. The Xylella blight has previously ravaged vineyards in California and citrus groves in Brazil, EFSA says. A local campaign group called Peacelink disputes the EU data on the disease, however, arguing that a fungal infection is most likely to blame. In a letter to EU Health and Food Safety Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis, Peacelink says more than 500 olive trees treated for fungi have recovered since spring last year. It says research by the University of Foggia pointed to fungi, rather than Xylella, as the cause. Peacelink urged the EU not to destroy olive trees en masse in the affected area, saying such a move would be \"totally unnecessary\".\n",

The Co-op has begun a three-year plan to steady the business after deep problems emerged in 2013 with its bank, which it has since largely sold off. In 2014, it made a net profit of £216m selling its pharmacy chain and farms. Chief executive Richard Pennycock said without the proceeds of the sales the group would have, \"at best, broken even\". He said the organisation had made good progress reducing its costs, which had fallen from £176m to £146m and it had also cut its debts from £1.4bn to £808m. Co-op Group chairman Allan Leighton told the BBC that the business had strayed a long way: 'We lost the heart of what the Co-op was. I mean look at what's happened to the business, it's terrible. \"The Co-op did used to stand for something and it was in the community, membership was important. Co-operation was important, but we've had unco-operation, we should have been called the unco-operative.

It plans to expand by adding another 100 outlets this year. But despite the improving performance, the business warned it would not be paying a dividend to its members until 2018. Last year, the Co-op recorded a net loss of £2.3bn, once one-off losses relating to its bank and its then-owned Somerfield business were taken into account. It was forced to divest itself of a large chunk of the bank to a number of private investors, largely hedge funds, and now owns just 20% of that business.

In a statement on Friday, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said she is also to establish a fund to tackle organised crime associated with paramilitary groups. The two unionist parties now say they will join cross-party talks on Monday. Unionists had said the issue of continued paramilitary activity was crucial to their involvement. Democratic Unionist Party leader Peter Robinson said he was \"content\" with the announcement. \"Policing and security in Northern Ireland is not just the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive, the secretary of state has a particular responsibility as well,\" Mr Robinson said. The National Crime Agency (NCA) became operational in Northern Ireland in May. Given its wide-ranging remit and resources, it would be reasonable to assume it knows the extent of paramilitary involvement in organised crime in Northern Ireland. It should be in a position to provide an assessment of paramilitary involvement to the Northern Ireland Secretary and political parties. So, it seems unlikely that the review to be published by the independent panel in October will tell Theresa Villiers and political parties anything they could not be told today by the NCA and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is due to speak to MEPs on Thursday, the day after the ratification vote. The speech will be the first made to a full meeting of the Parliament by a Canadian PM. New Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen will also make his first address to MEPs on Tuesday. As well as that, MEPs are due to vote on new legislation relating to border checks and terrorist offences. They will also vote on a motion setting out their position on where the EU should go after Brexit. Here are the main events coming up in the week ahead... The sitting will kick off in the afternoon with a debate on ways to promote greater use of natural pesticides in European farming. In a motion on Wednesday, MEPs are likely to call for current EU authorisation rules for such pesticides to be eased. The day's main debate is on suggestions for improving the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS), a scheme which aims to reduce carbon emissions. The scheme works by making large power plants buy \"allowances\" authorising them to emit greenhouse gases, within an overall agreed limit. Critics of the system say it is ineffective because the price of permits is too low and the overall cap has become overly generous due to lower economic activity. The EU Commission has proposed to increase the speed at which emissions permits are withdrawn from the market in the nine years running up to 2030. MEPs will take a position on the changes on Wednesday, although the necessary agreement from EU governments on where to go from here has not yet been found. In the evening, they will debate non-binding reports in a number of areas, including one on the EU's competition policy. They will also debate a draft motion which calls for whistleblowers to gain greater protection in EU law. The day begins with a debate on three separate motions on the future of the treaties and powers of the EU.

He has spent time in jail in both Thailand and Canada for sexually abusing young boys. Corrections officials from the province of British Columbia (BC) issued a public warning following Neil's release on Sunday. BC Corrections spokeswoman Cindy Rose said in a statement that Neil will be \"subject to an intensive level of monitoring and supervision in the community\".

In December 2015 he pleaded guilty to five new charges involving the sexual abuse of young boys in Cambodia and possession of child pornography in Canada.

The Arkleston Road/A761 junction in Paisley headed the list. The charity, which promotes walking and cycling, said the results highlight the importance of better infrastructure. The findings will be presented at the Scottish Transport Applications and Research conference this week. Locations with dangerous junctions included Wallyford, Dundee, Tranent, Inverness and Stirling. Roundabouts were featured in eight of the dangerous junctions, with seven others being T-junctions or staggered junctions. Sustrans Scotland director John Lauder said: \"Safety is often cited as the main reason why people don't cycle for more of the journeys they make every day. \"This research highlights the importance of having high-quality cycling infrastructure in place at junctions, so that collisions can be prevented. \"We know that better cycle infrastructure increases the feeling of safety and ultimately the number of people on bikes.\" He added: \"Put quite simply: the more people in a place who cycle, the safer it becomes for everyone.\" Sustrans Scotland has been working with local authorities to address some of the specific concerns.

Universities Minister Jo Johnson said the sale would have \"no impact on people with student loans\". But the National Union of Students said it was an \"ugly move on students\". \"It is outrageous that bankers will profit off the backs of graduates who took out loans because they had no other option,\" said the union's vice-president Sorana Vieru. The government has had a long-standing aim to sell the student loan book to private investors - with types of loans being sold in separate stages. Over the next four years it aims to dispose of the loans from before 2012, when tuition fees in England were trebled to £9,000 per year. The slice of loans now being put on sale - dating from 2002 to 2006 - have a face value of £4bn. The government is promising that there will be \"no changes to the terms and conditions\" for borrowers - so that rates of repayment for former students will remain the same. It means that interest on these student loans will become an income for private investors, but repayments will continue to be collected through taxation and the Student Loans Company. The Intergenerational Foundation think tank has calculated that a student borrowing for three years' tuition could pay back £54,000 - before debts are cancelled after 30 years. The Universities Minister Jo Johnson says the sale of assets is part of the drive to bring \"public finances under control\". But he said it would \"only proceed once we are satisfied that it represents value for money for the taxpayer\". David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, said it was the right time to start the sale process. \"This sale makes sense for taxpayers and will play an important contribution in our work to repair the public finances,\" he said.

            "Input: summarize: It was widely anticipated the Spending Review would confirm the need for police efficiencies would remain at the top of the agenda, at least until 2020. The Home Office is not one of the favoured \"protected\" ministries shielded from cuts. And as 71% of its gross spending goes on crime and policing, that is where most of the department's cuts have bitten. Add to that Home Secretary Theresa May's determination to reform policing, and there was a strong sense the government would not change course. That was certainly the expectation at Manchester Town Hall, where chief constables and police and crime commissioners (PCCs) had gathered for their annual joint conference. At 12:30, a large group of them took their places around a television set in a room set aside for exhibitors to watch the chancellor's statement. The mood was sombre. Most chiefs and PCCs had been planning for cuts of 20-25%. The Inspectorate of Constabulary had suggested that by 2018, forces would have to shed at least 12,000 officer, staff and police community support officer (PCSO) posts, with further reductions after that. The inspectorate, known for its careful, measured commentary, warned some forces might not be able to withstand another round of cuts, because they were not efficient enough. It said the \"operational viability\" of some could be \"in jeopardy\". The National Police Chiefs Council, which co-ordinates the work of forces, feared the job losses would be even worse - 35,000 by 2020, which, Sara Thornton, who chairs the council, said in July, would be a \"game changer\". Constabularies with large urban areas stood to lose the most, as they tend to rely more on Home Office funding, among them Northumbria, which gets 85% of its income from central government, and the West Midlands, 83%. So, when the announcement came, towards the end of Mr Osborne's statement, that there would be no further policing cuts, there was genuine disbelief, mixed with delight. Kevin Hurley, Surrey's PCC, described the atmosphere as \"euphoric\", as though England had won the World Cup. Essex Chief Constable Steve Kavanagh held his hand over his mouth in shock.\n",

But after passing stringent new safety tests, Kyushu Electric Power restarted the number one reactor at its Sendai plant on Tuesday morning. There is still strong public unease about a return to nuclear power. Protests have been taking place outside the Sendai plant and at Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's residence in Tokyo, about 1,000 km (600 miles) away. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo says that after being told a disaster like Fukushima could never happen, public confidence has been shaken. A total of 25 plants have applied to be restarted, he says, but all are facing legal challenges from concerned locals. What is happening inside the Sendai reactor? Kyushu said reactor No.1 at Sendai began operating again at 10:30 local time (01:30 GMT). TV images showed the plant's control room as workers turned the reactor back on. Kyushu Electric spokesman Tomomitsu Sakata said the reactor had gone back online without any problems. It will be about 24 hours before a full reaction takes place, and the plant is expected to start generating power by Friday. It will reach full capacity some time next month. Prime Minister Abe said on Monday that the reactors had passed \"the world's toughest safety screening\". \"I would like Kyushu Electric to put safety first and take utmost precautions for the restart,\" he said. Since shutting down all nuclear plants, Japan has been relying on imported fossil fuels for its energy, at huge expense. The government has said nuclear power must resume to cut both import bills and growing CO2 emissions. Experts have also warned that reactors left idle for years tend to experience teething problems and that such a mass restart of dormant reactors has never been attempted before, says our correspondent.

UKIP says it has evidence that smears about its candidates are being spread by Conservative Central Office, which it claims has been trawling would-be UKIP councillors' Twitter and Facebook pages for months. \"Were we inclined to return the favour, we would find even more examples to use against them. \"We deem that using our candidates as cannon fodder to undermine a political campaign (is) morally reprehensible and downright dirty,\" said a spokesman.

            "Input: summarize: Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi announced that Tiran and Sanafir would be transferred in April, during a visit by Saudi Arabia's King Salman. More than 150 people were jailed in connection with protests over the deal, though many were later acquitted or had their sentences reduced on appeal. The Egyptian government has said it will challenge Tuesday's ruling. Tiran and Sanafir are uninhabited and located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, a strategic part of the Red Sea bordered by Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Egyptian troops have been stationed there since 1950 at Riyadh's request. Mr Sisi's decision in April to cede control of them to Saudi Arabia sparked widespread criticism. The president was accused of violating the constitution and \"selling\" the islands in return for a multi-billion dollar aid package unveiled by King Salman during his visit. But Mr Sisi insisted that Tiran and Sanafir had always belonged to Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, Egypt's State Council, an administrative court, issued a verdict annulling April's maritime borders agreement between Cairo and Riyadh. The maritime border agreement signed earlier this year between Egypt and Saudi Arabia took many Egyptians by surprise. Since then, protesters have taken to the streets calling the arrangement unconstitutional, and accusing the government of giving away Egyptian territories in return for aid packages and investments worth billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia, a strong backer of President Sisi. Some of these protesters were arrested and charged with disrupting public order. A few are still behind bars. The lawsuit was filed by a number of prominent human rights lawyers, headed by a former presidential candidate, Khaled Ali. When the verdict was issued, many cheered inside the courtroom, chanting \"the islands are Egyptian\". But the legal battle has not come to an end yet, because the decision can be appealed. The verdict stated that the two islands would \"remain under Egyptian sovereignty\". If it is approved by the country's High Administrative Court it will become legally binding. However, the State Lawsuits Authority, which represents the Egyptian state in lawsuits, said on Tuesday evening that it would challenge the ruling, state television reported.

Sir Thomas said a \"smaller service\" would have to \"work smarter\". In December, the chief of the Met Police warned public safety would be at risk unless radical measures were taken to deal with funding cuts. But speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, newly knighted Sir Thomas said: \"Austerity is here to stay. \"The police have already made, and done it well in the main, cuts of 20% in the last four years and they are facing cuts of a further 5% next year. \"There will inevitably be a time where they can't take any more but let us remember that measured crime has fallen dramatically - but so have the demands made on the police.\" Asked if there was room for further cuts, Sir Thomas said: \"In some respects there are further efficiencies to be obtained, that is undoubtedly the case. \"They [police forces] need to work smarter because they will be working smaller.\" Sir Thomas said forces had not done enough work to analyse new demands being made on them, particularly with regards to cyber crime. He also said that while any crime reported to the police had to be taken seriously, there were some crimes that were \"more serious than others\". \"Nobody would argue that shoplifting is as serious as a violent assault and therefore the police need to look for the crimes that matter most to people, that do greatest harms to communities - serious and organised crime, drugs, violent offences, the grooming and sexual exploitation of children,\" he said. Last month, Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said that unless police \"act fast\" and with \"courage\" to implement far-reaching reforms, the cuts would endanger public safety. He suggested police forces in England and Wales should merge and share resources with other emergency services. Sir Hugh Orde, the Association of Chief Police Officers' president, has also recently warned that police forces were struggling to deal with reductions in funding.\n",

            "Input: summarize: Dead Sheep focuses on the events leading up to Howe's infamous 1990 resignation speech, in which he savaged his long-time boss and one-time political soulmate Margaret Thatcher. That speech - one of the first to be shown on television live from the House of Commons - was the beginning of Thatcher's downfall as prime minister. It was all the more remarkable because no one thought Howe had it in him to be Thatcher's political assassin. Least of all Thatcher herself. Howe had been at her side as her chancellor, foreign secretary and deputy prime minister since the very beginning of her reign in Downing Street. But he was often viewed as an ineffectual yes-man, and was someone she increasingly treated with impatience and disdain, in front of cabinet colleagues. The play's title comes from one of the most widely-quoted political put-downs of all time, when Labour's Dennis Healey described being attacked by Howe as like being \"savaged by a dead sheep\". Howe's frustration at Thatcher's increasingly strident anti-EU stance at a time when he was trying to negotiate Britain's membership of the European Exchange Rate mechanism, and his demotion to the \"non-job\" of deputy prime minister, was the trigger for his resignation. His resignation speech, given two weeks after he quit the cabinet, stunned the Commons into silence, as he compared himself to a cricketer who had been sent out to the crease, only to discover his bat had been smashed by the team's captain. But in an era packed with larger-than-life Conservative politicians such as Michael Heseltine, Alan Clark and Thatcher herself, the famously uncharismatic Howe is still not the obvious choice to place centre stage. \"I just admire him so much because he really, really meant it. In all these films and plays I've seen he gets treated like a shifty-eyed buffoon and I was thinking 'No!,'\" playwright Jonathan Maitland told BBC News after the play's opening night. \"I've read his book umpteen times.

But Hollingsworth said: \"We are here to win medals, but within both the letter and the spirit of the Paralympics.\" Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, an 11-time Paralympic champion, has said the issue \"goes to the heart of the integrity of the sport\". The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) says the system is always under review, while UK Athletics said it will review classifications after Rio. The Paralympics start on 7 September and run until 18 September. The classification system puts athletes into groups depending on the level of their impairment to try to ensure fair competition. But British T37 200m sprinter Bethany Woodward told the Sunday Times she was withdrawing from the ParalympicsGB squad for Rio and had lost faith in the way the team was selected. Woodward, 23, who has cerebral palsy, said: \"I represented my country for a long time but if I can't compete like I used to compete, because they've brought in people who are not like me in terms of disability, what's the point?\" UK Athletics has said that Woodward was not in consideration for selection because she had not met the necessary criteria. It has also been claimed some competitors try to manipulate their classification to compete against athletes with more severe impairments and therefore improve their chances of success. A recent IPC report found no clear evidence of \"intentional misrepresentation\" after analysing some 80 cases.

The most controversial were the 14 \"Class A\" war criminals, including wartime leader Hideki Tojo, who were \"enshrined\" in the late 1970s. These men were the ones who ordered and oversaw Japan's brutal war in China and South East Asia. Yasukuni Shrine It was a war in which millions died, in which there were widespread massacres of civilians, in which rape was routinely used as a weapon and where Japan used chemical and biological warfare against civilians. So if the shrine is so offensive to China and South Korea why did Mr Abe go? Firstly, because he wanted to. Close observers of the Japanese prime minister say he is at heart a nationalist and a historical revisionist. He believes the trials that convicted Japan's wartime leaders were \"victors' justice\". His own grandfather Nobusuke Kishi served in the war cabinet and was arrested by the Americans on suspicion of being a Class A war criminal. He was later released without charge. But the stain of association with Japan's war crimes in China never completely went away. Secondly, Mr Abe's support base comes from the right wing of the Liberal Democratic Party. According to Professor Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo, Mr Abe is \"showing he is a tough guy\", that he is not afraid of China. It is something that plays very well to his base. But there is perhaps a bigger goal that Mr Abe has in mind. He wants to radically revise Japan's post-war constitution. This, too, is a long-held dream that started with his grandfather in the 1950s. Mr Abe believes he is the man to complete the historic task of getting rid of the hated \"peace constitution\". Like many on the right here, Mr Abe believes that constitution was forced on Japan by America and is a humiliation. It imposes not only pacifism, but also Western notions of human rights and civil liberties. It rejects Japan's uniqueness in favour of \"universal values\". Mr Abe would like to change a lot of this.

The study recommended that companies release data showing how their devices work out measurements. The accuracy of seven wrist devices were tested while 60 volunteers were asked to walk, run and cycle. Researchers found that six out of seven of the fitness devices were good at estimating the heart rate of the person wearing it, with an error rate under 5%. They were the Apple Watch, Fitbit Surge, Basis Peak, Microsoft Band, PulseOn and MIP Alpha 2 - but the Samsung Gear S2 had the highest error rate of 6.8%. However, when it came to keeping track of energy used during exercise, the five devices that performed this function were all a long way out. Not one of the devices had an error rate below 20% - and some, such as the PulseOn, were much more inaccurate, the US research team found. Dr Euan Ashley, co-author of the study from the department of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford University, said the public should be aware of the strengths and limitations of fitness devices worn on the wrist. \"People need to know that on energy expenditure they give rough estimates. \"If you go to the gym, and you think you've lost 400 calories, then you might feel you've got 400 calories to play with,\" he said. That could be an issue if people were basing their diet on what they thought they had burnt off, he said. Technology for measuring heart rate had moved on quickly over the past five or six years, but on energy expenditure \"it's not quite there yet\", he added. It may be that companies are not using heart rates in their calculations. There is also a very wide difference in calories burnt between one person and another. For example, 10,000 steps could equate to anything from 400 kilocalories to 800 kilocalories lost, depending on a person's height and weight alone, the study said. Dr David Ellis, lecturer in computation social science at Lancaster University, said working out the number of calories burnt was a tricky business and relied on many different factors such as height, weight, percentage of body fat, heart rate and more. \"However, because manufactures do not share the algorithms [which are constantly updated] used to determine calories burned, it is almost impossible to know the exact\n",

The former resident of Marsh Farm Estate in Luton has pleaded not guilty to murder, rape and sexual assault. A man who saw Mr Maguire stabbed three times said the accused \"showed no regrets or remorse\" afterwards. Luton Crown Court heard the attacks happened at Mr Maguire's home in Thrales Close between 18:00 and 20:15. The prosecution allege Mr Nelson was in the middle of a spree of violence, having sexually assaulted a 25-year-old woman in the stairway of some flats and then a 60-year-old woman in her flat. Witness Dennis Kamau said he and his girlfriend were looking to buy some cannabis when he came across Mr Nelson near the Nisa store on the estate. He took the pair to Mr Maguire's home where the men entered the house while the woman stayed outside. After the pair agreed to share a deal, they went to the kitchen where Mr Maguire removed a tin from a kitchen cabinet.

They are one of only two known breeding pairs in Wales, with a second pair nesting near Croesor in the Glaslyn Valley. Staff and volunteers at the Cors Dyfi nature reserve had an anxious wait for the chicks who took 32 hours to emerge from their shells. Cracks in the first egg were spotted on Friday afternoon, with the bird finally hatching at about 21:00 BST. The second chick started chipping away from inside its egg on Saturday afternoon but did not hatch until 20:40 BST on Sunday. Monty and Glesni became a breeding pair for the first time this year after Monty's previous partner of two years, Nora, did not return from her African migration. Ospreys return from migration in late March or April and usually lay eggs two or three weeks later. But Monty and Glesni did not pair until 3 May and their two eggs were laid between 22 and 25 May - six weeks later than average.

Simmonds landed his fourth kick to convert a second-half penalty try. A Sam Skinner score and a second Short effort ensured the bonus-point victory. The win lifts them to within a point of leaders Wasps, who face Gloucester on Sunday. For 20-year-old fly-half Simmonds, it was the perfect day with the boot as he replaced injured veteran Gareth Steenson in a side that was missing a number of players - including England's Jack Nowell and Henry Slade - due to Six Nations duties. Newcastle, who a week earlier earned an impressive 46-31 win over Northampton at Kingston Park, made a strong start with Goneva crossing for a superb try, which started with a bustling run from Calum Green. Short, who would finish the day by touching down for the fifth time in two games, restored parity for the first time with a 90-metre effort, which came from an error as Newcastle closed in on a second try. While Exeter were made to work hard for their first-half lead after Vickers again edged Falcons ahead, the hosts were more ruthless after the break and heavily restricted Newcastle, who are still without a win at Sandy Park. Exeter Chiefs assistant coach Ali Hepher: \"Newcastle are a good side and in good form and came here with a good deal of confidence but we started poorly, especially in defence. \"We were hesitant in that first half particularly when we had ball in hand as we needed to run hard instead of trying the clever ball. \"There was plenty to address at half-time but our defence was outstanding in that second half and to earn a bonus point was invaluable. \"Moving one point into second and above Saracens at this stage is not important as the top four places are really tight but we are hoping to remain there and to secure a top two finish would be really nice.\" Newcastle Falcons director of rugby Dean Richards: \"I'm disappointed as we started really well but we weren't accurate enough and this allowed them back into the game. \"We should have been further\n",

When her college friends realised that she had never tasted a macaron - a small, colourful circular cake made from ground almonds and filled with cream or icing - they whisked her to one of the best macaron shops in the French capital. After just one bite, Ms Dhingra decided there and then that when she returned to Mumbai she would open her own macaron store, the first of its kind in India. \"This might sound dramatic, but I realised that yes, this is what I want to do, I want to go back to India and take macarons with me. This was my mission,\" she says. Fast forward seven years, and Ms Dhingra, now 28, is the owner of three busy macaron shops in Mumbai. Another three stores will open in the city this year, and she has plans to expand her business, Le 15 Patisserie, across the country. Yet as a young businesswoman in India, she says it hasn't always been plain sailing. Ms Dhingra should have been a lawyer. But while studying law at university in Mumbai, she decided that she wanted to quit to do something more creative. Remembering helping her mother in the kitchen during her childhood, she decided to work with food instead of legal cases. So she convinced her parents to let her go to Switzerland to study hospitality and management. After three years at a Swiss catering college, Ms Dhingra did one year at the well-known Le Cordon Bleu school in Paris. Returning to Mumbai upon graduation, she set to work in her parents' kitchen on developing her own macaron recipe. Yet with the weather in Mumbai being substantially hotter and more humid than Paris, she struggled for half a year, as the heat and humidity makes it difficult to make the delicate cakes. \"When I started making macarons, first at my home kitchen, it was a complete disaster,\" she says. \"It took me around six months of research and 60 failed recipes to finally get something right.\" When she finally had a recipe she was proud of, her businessman father agreed to invest the initial funds she required to set up the business. Yet being both young and female meant she faced additional challenges. \"The biggest problem was to get people to take you seriously,\" she\n",

IAAF chief Lamine Diack told BBC Sport athletics is \"in crisis\" but said \"90% to 95%\" of athletes are clean. Meadows, 33, was beaten to European gold by a Russian drug cheat in 2011. German television station WDR broadcast three documentaries alleging that 99% of Russian athletes are doping and that IAAF officials were implicated in covering it up. The claims have been rejected as a \"pack of lies\" by the Russian Athletics Federation and Diack told BBC Sport that the figure was \"a joke\" and \"ridiculous\".

            "Input: summarize: Rising energy prices pushed inflation to 1.8% in January, a near four-year high and up from 1.1% in December. Eurostat data also showed the jobless rate fell to 9.6% in December, the lowest rate since May 2009. GDP growth edged up to 0.5% in the final three months of 2016, up from 0.4% in the previous quarter. The rise in eurozone inflation last month was driven by an 8.1% jump in energy prices in January compared with the year before. The spike in the rate takes it up to the European Central Bank's inflation target of close to, but below, 2%. Some have called for the European Central Bank to further scale back its bond-buying programme. However, the ECB also looks at core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food prices, in its policy decisions, and this rate remained unchanged at 0.9% in January. In December, the ECB said it would buy bonds worth 60bn euros a month from April. The 80bn euro-a-month quantitative easing scheme had been due to end in March, but was expected to be extended. The stimulus programme was an effort to increase the supply of money in the economic bloc to keep interest rates low, and encourage borrowing and spending. The European Central Bank's key job is to maintain \"price stability\" in the Eurozone, which it interprets as inflation of below but close to 2%. For the last few years it has been wrestling with inflation that its governing council considers too low, at times even below zero - a situation of deflation or falling prices. That has led the bank to choose very unusual policies intended to stimulate prices rises - ultra-low interest rates (one of its rates is negative) and quantitative easing, buying financial assets with newly created money. So with inflation now at 1.8%, pretty much in line with the target, is that job done? Time to turn the policy taps off? Not necessarily. The rise in inflation is down to higher food and especially energy prices. The impact of those factors is likely to fade and other price rises are still relatively slow. There are different views in the ECB's governing council but the majority are not likely to be in a hurry to get policy back to normal.

Mr Lloyd, who has electromagnetic hypersensitivity, said he was entitled to direct payments to employ a helper. The council, which was ordered to pay £12,000 in costs, had claimed he was not capable of managing money. Quashing the council's decision on Wednesday, Mr Justice Singh said electromagnetic hypersensitivity was not a recognised condition in the UK. He added it was \"not a matter for the court to say what the decision would have been if the authority went about its decision correctly\". Direct payments are given to individuals by councils so they can buy help or services instead of having them supplied by the authority. Mr Lloyd lives in the back garden of a privately-owned home in Thornhill and has refused alternative accommodation and a portable toilet, the court heard. He urinates in plastic bottles and defecates in bed pans lined with black bin bags. He has no running water and an insurance company deemed the house uninhabitable after flooding and the discovery of asbestos - although that has since been removed. When council workers went to collect Mr Lloyd's waste in May, they found 90 litres of urine and 40 bags of faeces. He has meals delivered five times a week, including supplies for the weekend on a Friday. As he has no fridge, he has to have food which will not go off. Representing Mr Lloyd, Christian Howells said: \"Where he lives has to be adapted because the symptoms are very real to him.\" He described the situation as \"chicken and egg\" - Mr Lloyd wants the money to pay for help to improve his day-to-day life but the council felt he was not in a position to be given the funds. Rebecca Stickler, for the council, said: \"The housing department has offered housing in a field and various properties and he has refused them all. \"It can't possibly be the case that a local authority should be compelled to use the public purse to pay money to someone who they know cannot manage that payment.\" Mr Lloyd's private landlord has begun eviction proceedings in county court, he is estranged from his family and the council recognises him as homeless.\n",

But there will be two different pass marks - grade 4 as a \"standard\" pass and grade 5 as a \"strong\" pass. Researchers say pupils need to be at grade 5 to match global rivals. The study from the Education Policy Institute says England's school system faces an \"immense challenge\" if it is going to match the levels of achievement in countries such as Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan. GCSEs in England are being made more challenging and will be decided by final exams rather than coursework, with the first results of these new-style GCSEs being published for English and maths this week. These will be graded from 9 to 1, with a grade 4 being counted as a \"standard\" pass, similar to a grade C. But the researchers say that on average pupils should be achieving a \"strong\" pass at grade 5, if England is going to keep up with international competitors. At present, the researchers say, only 40% of pupils in state schools have reached this \"world-class standard\". To keep up in maths, the study says, it would require an increase of over a third of pupils getting top grades and an average above grade 5. \"The old C grade is not an adequate national aspiration if England wants to compete with top education nations,\" says David Laws, former Education Minister and executive chairman of the Education Policy Institute. \"This analysis highlights the gulf between education outcomes in England and the performance of the world's best education nations,\" he said. \"In certain subjects, such as maths, England needs both to significantly raise the number of top performers and almost halve the number of low performers if it is to compete with the world's best.\" Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers said: \"This report shows that England's obsession with structural change, under a succession of governments, has had little impact on either standards or equity. \"Policy makers have routinely pursued the wrong priorities,\" said Mr Whiteman. \"The highest performing school systems are those that invest in their teachers and that respect and value education.\" Kevin Courtney, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said that even if the overall results at national level were kept in line with previous years, individual schools\n",

It is thought Tolkien got to know the school while he was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University. The poems were printed a year before Tolkien's first literary sensation The Hobbit was published. The Shadow Man is an earlier version of a poem eventually published in 1962 in Tolkien's Adventures of Tom Bombadil collection. The existence of the poems came to light after American Tolkien scholar Wayne G. Hammond got in touch with the school. He knew from notes made by Tolkien that two of his poems appeared in a magazine he called The Abingdon Chronicle. This was actually the 1936 annual of Our Lady's School, which was then run by the Sisters of Mercy. School principal Stephen Oliver said: \"At first we couldn't find the 1936 edition and referred Mr Hammond to the archives of the Sisters of Mercy in London. \"Then, while preparing for an event for former pupils of the school, we uncovered our own copy and I saw the two poems Mr Hammond had been looking for. \" The school hopes to put the annual on display at a future exhibition.\n",

However 59% of voters opposed the plan in Sunday's referendum vote. The government will now need to find an alternative, which may involve higher tax rates for multinational companies. \"It will not be possible to find a solution overnight,\" said Ueli Maurer, Switzerland's finance minister. He told a press conference it could take a year to come up with a new plan, and that Switzerland risked losing foreign investment as a result. Currently Switzerland grants special status to foreign firms which allows cantons, or districts, to offer them lower rates of tax than domestic firms, making Switzerland an attractive destination for foreign investors. But international organisations such as the OECD have deemed the system unacceptable and Switzerland has made a commitment to reform it by 2019. To avoid raising taxes for multinational companies too sharply the government had agreed to abolish the special status for multinationals but instead offer new tax breaks for research and development and other activities. As part of the proposal, Switzerland's cantons planned to lower their tax rates for businesses across the board, including domestic business, helping to avoid steep rises in tax bills when foreign firms' status was brought into line. Some of the resulting budget shortfall in the cantons would have been plugged by federal funds. But the plan was opposed by Social Democrats, Greens, trade unions and churches who argued that the reduced tax revenue would still lead to cuts in public services or higher personal taxes. \"The conservative parties wanted to push through tax reform with arrogance and haughtiness against the interests of the people.

            "Input: summarize: How much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why. It used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier. This is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows. Then we had the financial crisis of 2008. The upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them. For example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of £27,000 at the age of 28, compared with £28,000 for those born in the 1970s. The figure was £21,000 for those born in the 1960s and £15,000 for those born in the 1950s. Despite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age. By their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about £27,000 each, on average. By the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - £53,000 each. A large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither. At the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s. Home ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30. Similarly, the Local Government Association reported in December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago. The lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices. In their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs. At the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by\n",

            "Input: summarize: Nonsuch Palace was painted by the Flemish artist Joris Hoefnagel in 1568. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has placed a temporary export bar on the watercolour in the hope a UK buyer can match the asking price of £1m. \"We have very few paintings of the palace so I really hope we can find a buyer to keep this masterpiece here in Britain,\" he said. The piece is the oldest of six remaining depictions of the palace, considered to be one of the Renaissance period's most stunning buildings. Nonsuch Palace - named because no other palace could equal it - was built in 1538 for the Tudor king to celebrate the birth of his first legitimate son and mark his 30th year on the throne, It was intended to rival the opulent residences of French king Francis I. In 1670 Charles II gave the palace to his mistress, Barbara Villiers, who began to dismantle and sell parts of the building to pay off gambling debts. By 1690 the building had all but disappeared. The painting went for auction in 2010 but failed to meet its reserve price of £1.2m. The decision to defer the export licence follows a recommendation by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA), administered by Arts Council England. They made their recommendation on the grounds of its close association with our history and national life, its outstanding aesthetic importance and its outstanding significance for understanding the nature of English Renaissance architecture. The decision on the export licence application for the watercolour will be deferred until 31 May.\n",

It's a great achievement for us, I'm so happy I can't even explain how I'm feeling right now The result meant the tie finished level at 2-2 on aggregate, with Zimbabwe qualifying on the away-goals rule. It was disappointment for Cameroon who represented Africa at the Women's World Cup in Canada, reaching the second round. Neshamba (pictured) was again Zimbabwe's match-winner, having scored their crucial away-goal in the first leg in Yaounde.

They were only able to continue in this qualifying tournament after Ivory Coast withdrew. Also on Sunday, South Africa defeated Equatorial Guinea 1-0 in Bata to win the tie by the same score on aggregate after the first leg had ended goal-less.

We've all got a bit of egg on our face.\" Bookmakers have been cheering Leicester's success, whilst simultaneously putting their hands in their collective pockets. William Hill has paid out more than £20,000 to 39-year-old carpenter, Leigh Herbert. He was one of the canny few to take up the now-famous odds of 5,000-1 for his team to win. Although he has been a supporter since he was 10, he doesn't usually put his money where his heart is. But, mulling over their prospects on a camping holiday he found he was encouraged by the team's performance at the end of last season, and, taking a shine to the appointment of Claudio Ranieri as manager, he decided to put down the £5 bet for his team to win. \"I thought, they're going to do something special this season,\" he says. \"I really enjoyed the first half of the season, the second half just got harder and harder. \"I would feel sick watching them play.\" Eventually, he cashed out £2 of his £5 bet, making £5,600, but left the £3 remainder in place, which eventually won him £15,000. A big party is in order this weekend - as well as house hunting with his new deposit. Bookmakers, like Coral, estimate the industry as a whole will have paid out around £20m over the title win. Coral themselves lost £2m. But bookmakers won't have lost out overall, admits Ladbrokes' Alex Donohue.

During the trial at the Old Bailey, jurors heard that they both suffered from learning disabilities, but Judge Christopher Moss said they were still \"able to organise and carry out this dreadful murder\". As they were led from the dock, Bagnall launched into a tirade of abuse at the judge and shouted out \"I'm glad he's dead\" in the courtroom packed with Ben's family. In a statement, Ben's mother, Joanne Treston-Smith, said: \"The void that Ben's death has left will never be filled. We will always have him missing in our lives.\" The court heard that the murder followed a feud between Michael Bagnall and the victim, who was going out with the Bagnall's ex-girlfriend. Bagnall was said to have resented the new relationship and sent the girl \"threatening messages\" by phone or Facebook. On the day of his murder, Ben Purdy decided to confront Bagnall, tracking him down in which led to a \"skirmish\" in Bermondsey, south London.

Her three-day old daughter, Isabella, was removed from her for five days in April 2010. The lawsuit argued that the opiate test in question had a far lower threshold than federal guidelines. Jameson Hospital failed to inform Ms Mort that she had failed the test, then reported it to Lawrence County children and youth services without a secondary test. \"Elizabeth Mort never imagined that the last thing she ate before giving birth to her daughter - a poppy seed bagel - would lead to the loss of her newborn, but that is exactly what happened after the Jameson Health System failed to account for the possibility that her positive urine drug screen was due to her ingestion of poppy seeds,\" the lawsuit said. Child welfare officials arrived the day after the family returned from hospital with an emergency protective custody order and took Isabella. She was later returned after the agency could find no evidence Ms Mort had used illegal drugs. The lawsuit, which was filed on her behalf by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), was settled on Tuesday. ACLU officials said Jameson had changed its policy to ensure newborns were not taken from parents solely on the basis of maternal drug test results. \"We hope that this case will encourage hospitals that routinely test pregnant women for drug use to reconsider that practice due to the harm that can result from false positives,\" said ACLU lawyer Sara Rose.\n",

The 29-year-old will return to action on Wednesday, 26 April, in Stuttgart after being handed a wildcard. Although some fellow players have expressed misgivings, she has the support of the WTA tour, and her fans. And, with biggest commercial rival Serena Williams announcing she is pregnant and facing time away from the game, the Russian's return is certainly timely. In the year from June 2015, Forbes estimates the five-time Grand Slam winner made $1.9m (£1.5m) in prize money from playing, but a whopping $20m from endorsements, a sum matched only by Williams. And it is this primary source of earnings that Sharapova will be looking to reinvigorate. \"During her time out there will have been some continued relationship with her sponsors,\" says Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford. \"But I am sure there will have been some sort of penalty clause in her sponsor contracts for incurring a suspension.\" Following Sharapova's admission in March 2016 that she had tested positive for a banned drug at that year's Australian Open, she was initially banned by the International Tennis Federation for two years, later reduced on appeal. But unlike golfer Tiger Woods, who haemorrhaged sponsors very quickly after his extra-marital affairs came to light, Sharapova's backers waited to see how things played out. \"That was because they had invested so much money and effort into their deals,\" says Prof Chadwick. \"Also, to terminate deals could have been dangerous as she might come back successfully, and if you as a sponsor have decided to cancel her contract then the door has been left wide open for a rival.\" As it was the sponsor reaction was mixed - Head and Evian were immediately supportive, Nike and Porsche put their relationships on hold but later came back on board, while Tag Heuer and Avon chose not to extend deals that had ended. Given the large amounts of money and time invested - Nike's relationship with the player dates back to when she was 11 years old - it is not surprising the major brands wanted to think hard before reaching their decisions. \"In terms of\n",

There are limits on warheads and on launchers, which must be implemented within seven years of the treaty's entry into force. Warheads: Under the New Start treaty each side is allowed a maximum of 1,550 warheads. This is about 30% lower than the figure of 2,200 that each side was meant to reach by 2012 under the Start treaty (as revised in the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty). Launchers: Each country is allowed, in total, no more than 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear arms. Another 100 are allowed if they are not operationally deployed - for example, missiles removed from a sub undergoing a long-term overhaul. The new limit on delivery systems is less than half the ceiling of 1,600 specified in the original Start treaty. Not as dramatic as they might appear. The rules for counting warheads contain a big loophole. While each warhead on a ballistic missile is counted as one warhead, a heavy bomber is counted as carrying \"one warhead\" even though it may carry (in the case of a US B-52) up to 20 of them. According to the Arms Control Association, a pro-disarmament pressure group, the US could theoretically meet the new limits by cutting just 100 warheads, while Russia would only need to cut 190. In addition, the agreed ceilings refer to deployed warheads, not to warheads in storage. A warhead could, in theory, be put into storage, and then redeployed when needed. The cuts in launchers are also, in practice, not all that challenging. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists estimates that Russia currently has 566 - well under the permitted ceiling of 700. It estimates that the US has 798, necessitating a cut of about 12%. Supporters of the deal say that while it does not make big cuts, it is a useful confidence-building measure, which could pave the way for further nuclear deals with Russia. They say it also signals to the rest of the world that the US and Russia are not ignoring\n",

But earlier this month the course was found to be 380m too short and all timings for the 2013, 2014 and 2015 events were declared null and void. Guinness World Records said the record Mr Sexty set will no longer stand. \"We would invite Jack to go for the record again in the future and we hope this won't deter him from breaking records in the future,\" a spokesman said. Mr Sexty, from Bristol, said he \"wouldn't be losing any sleep\" over the decision.

She was taken to St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey, and died after an overdose of the anti-seizure drug phenytoin. Surrey Police asked the Woking coroner to halt the inquest to allow officers to re-examine the case after fresh expert evidence emerged at the hearing. During the last two months of her life, Sophie suffered a series of seizures triggered by a reaction to infections. The inquest heard this week that Dr Lojein Hatahet and paediatric consultant Dr Fiona MacCarthy had attempted to administer the anti-seizure drug using an automated syringe-driver. It failed to work and it was decided Dr Hatahet would administer the drug from a handheld syringe, despite the protests of nurse Polly Leavold, who said the drug was not needed and that giving it by hand was against the hospital's protocol.

The humanitarian situation has been described as \"catastrophic\" by the UN, with more than 2,000 people killed in the conflict. Opening the talks, Mr Ban said: \"Today Yemen's very existence hangs in the balance.\" He urged action on three main areas: \"First, a renewed humanitarian pause to allow critical assistance to reach all Yemenis in need and provide a respite for Yemenis as the holy month of Ramadan begins. \"Second, I urge the parties to reach agreement on local ceasefires. Third, I call on them to resume a peaceful and orderly political transition and to ensure that the process includes more representation from other political parties, women, youth and civil society.\" The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva said the Houthi representatives were apparently delayed over what airspace their plane could fly through. She said that the confusion did not bode well for the talks. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states has been bombing the Houthi rebels and their allies since March. The bombing campaign was launched to support Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who escaped to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, when the Houthis advanced on his stronghold in Aden in southern Yemen. In recent weeks, fighting between Saudi forces and the Houthis has intensified on Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia. On Saturday, Saudi Arabia claimed to have shot down a Scud missile fired by the Houthis.

The figure contrasted with a stronger-than-expected start for the manufacturing sector published on Monday. Factory output rose from 52.1 in December to 52.9 in January. Any figure above 50 indicates growth in the sector. Markit economist Tim Moore said construction firms were struggling for momentum, with increased economic uncertainty holding back new orders and contributing to one of the weakest rises in output levels since summer 2013. \"Taken together with the slowdown in new order growth, the latest survey suggests that construction companies are braced for a relatively subdued first quarter,\" he said. David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which compiles the survey along with Markit, said a shortage of bricks and blocks contributed to the slowdown. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said weakness in construction orders and a downturn in public sector infrastructure work, which accounts for about a quarter of total construction and is not covered by the PMI, suggested the sector would post only \"lacklustre growth\" this year. Optimism among construction companies waned to its lowest level since December 2014, the survey showed. \"Some firms highlighted concerns that underlying demand conditions had started to soften,\" Markit said. Analysts use the PMI surveys for early signals about the economy. However, the construction sector figures have been at odds with data used in official growth figures in recent months.

He said: \"The sustainable schools policy has been tested in court on several occasions and found to be a competent policy upon which to make decisions both about the future of individual schools and area planning more widely. \"I have already accepted the eight recommendations within the Northern Ireland Audit Office report and these are being progressed by my department.\" The policy is also used to plan educational provision across Northern Ireland. The PAC also said that the number of empty places in schools in Northern Ireland is \"likely to be overstated\". A Northern Ireland Audit Office (NIAO) report previously found the number of empty places totalled over 71,000, about 20% of capacity. However, the NIAO also said that the department did not have a standard method for calculating school capacity. The PAC said it was \"unacceptable\" that the department could not provide accurate numbers of surplus places. The committee is calling for up-to-date school enrolment figures to be gathered \"as a matter of urgency\". The PAC report also said the department took too long to take decisions on whether to close schools, and whether suspended teachers should be dismissed. It found that 106 teachers had been suspended during the past five years, but only six had been dismissed.

            "Input: summarize: Their study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, argued elderly people had the least to gain. The team at University College London (UCL) has called on doctors to discuss the risks more clearly with patients. The charity Diabetes UK said doctors needed to strike a careful balance when prescribing treatment. Type-2 diabetes is an inability to control blood sugar levels and is linked to lifestyle factors including diet and obesity. In the long-term it is linked to heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage and even blindness. Drugs such as metformin can be used to lower blood sugar levels to prevent the side effects. The report, which was carried out by the University of Michigan as well as UCL, said an average 45-year-old who dropped their blood sugar levels by one percentage point would gain 10 months of healthy life, compared with three weeks for a 75-year-old starting treatment. It added this needed to be balanced against the down-sides to a lifetime of medication including: Having to have multiple injections and blood sugar tests each day, drugs causing indigestion or sickness, or insulin treatments risking blood sugar levels dropping dangerously low (hypoglycaemia). One of the report's authors, Prof John Yudkin, told the BBC: \"What it means is if you're someone with type-2, it's your right to know what the benefits of the treatment are in terms of gain in life expectancy or reduction in heart attacks or going blind. \"And then you are entitled to decide, but not many doctors have got those figures to hand.\" He said GPs were too \"target focussed\" and were often looking only at the blood sugar level. The findings do not apply to people with type-1 diabetes. Commenting on the report, Simon O'Neill, the director for health intelligence at Diabetes UK, said: \"Sometimes there is a balance to be struck where certain medications might help give someone a longer life, but also cause side effects that might negatively impact on quality of life. \"This study highlights the importance of looking at the individual needs of the person with type-2 diabetes, rather than adopting a blanket approach.\" Patients are advised not to make any decisions without consulting their GP. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which advises the NHS on medication, said: \"The current NICE guidance on the management of type-2 diabetes recognise\n",

            "Input: summarize: Abdul Hakim Belhaj claims the UK government helped to arrange for him to be forcibly transported from China to Libya in 2004, just as he was about to fly to London to claim asylum. Mr Belhaj says he was then tortured as he had opposed the Gaddafi regime. Last December, the High Court found the claims were beyond its jurisdiction. At last year's hearing, the judge, Mr Justice Simon, said Abdul-Hakim Belhaj had a \"well-founded claim\" but pursuing it would jeopardise national security. Lawyers for Mr Belhaj have now taken the case to the Court of Appeal, where Richard Hermer QC said Mr Belhaj and his wife believed \"the UK played a key role in their mistreatment and wish to pursue a remedy against the UK and its officials for that\". Mr Belhaj, one of the leaders of the uprising against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, says he was abducted - along with his pregnant wife, Fatima Boudchar - in China in 2004 as he was about to fly to London to claim asylum. He alleged the UK had tipped off Libyan intelligence services and helped the US arrange his rendition. After he was returned to Libya, Mr Belhaj spent six years in jail, while his wife was released shortly before giving birth. The couple had been attempting to bring a case against former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and former senior MI6 official Sir Mark Allen. The High Court ruled that because most of the claims related to officials in China, Malaysia, Thailand and Libya the allegations were \"non-justiciable\" in the UK. Analysis By Dominic Casciani This case matters for one simple reason: it involves allegations that the UK colluded in handing over a man to a regime that tortured him. And a decade on from these events we are still no closer to finding out exactly what happened. The government has settled similar claims from former Guantanamo Bay inmates at a cost of millions of pounds - but a planned judge-led inquiry into these issues was scrapped. That judge, Sir Peter Gibson, said there needs to be further investigation into complicity in rendition and torture - and the task was handed to Parliamentarians on the Intelligence and Security Committee (\n",

            "Input: summarize: The Kurdish Peshmerga had held 20% of the town since December 2014, and although there had been daily fighting since then, the two sides had been at a stalemate. Since Thursday, though, the Kurdish forces - backed by US air strikes - have made important ground, cutting early on the Highway 47 which passes Sinjar, the main supply line between IS' self-styled capital of Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in northern Iraq. Capturing Sinjar will not only secure the highway, but the road south of Sinjar, towards the IS-held town of Baaj, is also reported to be under control of the Peshmerga forces. This is supposed to provide a buffer zone large enough to keep Sinjar safe in the near future. However, it is by no means preventing IS from using scores of small countryside roads south of Sinjar that are still available until the winter weather makes them unusable. The next step has to be against the IS-held town of Tal Afar, and then Mosul. If not, Sinjar will always face attacks from those points. Yet, if Sinjar is de facto Kurdish territory, Tal Afar and Mosul are not. Profile: Who are the Peshmerga? Who are the Yazidis? Tal Afar is populated with Arabs and Turkmen: this means that the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) will not have any strategic interest in liberating and holding an area to which it has no claim. The same goes for Mosul and Baaj. While KRG President Massoud Barzani has repeatedly hinted that his government would contribute to the retaking of Mosul, recapturing an Arab city could be perceived as an act of Kurdish aggression against Arabs, raising tensions with the Baghdad government and potentially harming the Kurdish minority that has continued to live in Mosul since IS took it. Tactically, the town of Baaj, situated on higher grounds than Sinjar, will remain a perfect spot to target Sinjar. Since the Peshmerga do not possess long-range missiles, how will they be able to create a strong enough buffer zone for the 3,000 Yazidis trapped on the mountain for more than a year to be able\n",

            "Input: summarize: The prisoner swap came after secret talks between the US government and the Taliban, brokered by Qatar. Bergdahl was serving with an Alaska-based infantry regiment in Paktika province near the Pakistani border and went missing on 30 June 2009, five months after being deployed to Afghanistan. The circumstances of his capture remain murky, with speculation he may have walked away from his base out of disillusionment with the US campaign. In March 2015, he was charged with desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy. The US believes he was across the frontier in Pakistan for most of his captivity, reportedly held by the Haqqani network, which operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and is allied to the Afghan Taliban. Profile: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl The circumstances of Sgt Bergdahl's capture in 2009 remain unclear, although a Pentagon investigation a year later concluded he left his post in Paktika Province without authorisation, according to a Pentagon official speaking to Associated Press news agency. Several commentators and soldiers have branded him a deserter and called for him to be punished. The New York Times said on his disappearance in 2009 had noted he had left military areas before, during a training programme in California and an Afghan outpost, but returned each time. US officials told the newspaper the report did not conclude whether Sgt Bergdahl had intended to permanently desert the military. The US military's top-ranking officer, Gen Martin Dempsey, has that the Army would not ignore misconduct but that the 28-year-old was innocent until proven guilty. \"When he is able to provide the facts, we'll learn what happened.\" The defence department opened up an investigation into his disappearance and capture, appointing a two-star general with combat experience in Afghanistan to lead the inquiry. Taliban officials say the 28-year-old was handed over near Khost, close to the the Afghan-Pakistan border, on the evening of 31 May. A several-dozen strong US special forces team flew in by helicopter and briefly met some 18 Taliban on the ground.

The 8.3 billion tonnes is as heavy as 25,000 Empire State Buildings in New York, or a billion elephants. The great issue is that plastic items, like packaging, tend to be used for very short periods before being discarded. More than 70% of the total production is now in waste streams, sent largely to landfill - although too much of it just litters the wider environment, including the oceans. \"We are rapidly heading towards 'Planet Plastic', and if we don't want to live on that kind of world then we may have to rethink how we use some materials, in particular plastic,\" Dr Roland Geyer told BBC News. A paper authored by the industrial ecologist from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and colleagues appears in the journal Science Advances. It is described as the first truly global assessment of how much plastic has been manufactured, how the material in all its forms is used, and where it ends up. Here are some of its key numbers. There is no question that plastics are a wonder material. Their adaptability and durability have seen their production and use accelerate past most other manmade materials apart from steel, cement and brick. From the start of mass-manufacturing in the 1950s, the polymers are now all around us - incorporated into everything from food wrapping and clothing, to aeroplane parts and flame retardants. But it is precisely plastics' amazing qualities that now present a burgeoning problem. None of the commonly used plastics are biodegradable. The only way to permanently dispose of their waste is to destructively heat it - through a decomposition process known as pyrolysis or through simple incineration; although the latter is complicated by health and emissions concerns. In the meantime, the waste mounts up. There is enough plastic debris out there right now, Geyer and colleagues say, to cover an entire country the size of Argentina. The team's hope is that their new analysis will give added impetus to the conversation about how best to deal with the plastics issue. \"Our mantra is you can't manage what you don't measure,\" Dr Geyer said. \"So, our idea was to put the numbers out there without us telling the world what the world should be\n",

He has granted the Aylesbury-based English Bridge Union permission for a full judicial review of its status. Sport England has refused to recognise the game and said it was no more a sporting activity than \"sitting at home, reading a book\". Mr Justice Mostyn, who said he played Bridge on social occasions, heard a claim the game ought to be recognised as a \"mind sport\" that exercises the \"brain muscle\". Kate Gallofent QC, for Sport England, said the definition of a qualifying sport was an \"activity aimed at improving physical fitness and well being, forming social relations and gaining results in competition\". That definition is based on a European Sports Charter promoting \"a common European definition of sport\". However, the judge was told other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Ireland and Poland, \"recognise Bridge as a sport\". Miss Gallofent insisted: \"The starting point of the definition of sport is physical activity. Bridge cannot ever satisfy this definition.\" Mr Justice Mostyn told her: \"If the brain is a muscle, it does. \"You are doing more physical activity playing Bridge, with all that dealing and playing, than in rifle shooting. \"In 1999, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognised that Bridge and Chess should be recognised as mind sports.\" The judge granted the union permission to mount a full judicial review challenge to Sport England. Contract Bridge is a complex game played by millions of people across the world in competitions and at social events. All the cards are dealt from a normal 52 card deck for each game. Two players from each of two teams sit opposite each other across a table and through a bidding process (auction) agree to win a number of tricks. Suits are ranked upwards - clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades and no trumps. If they achieve the number of tricks agreed at auction they win the game but if not they lose. The team with the highest number of games takes the rubber. These are the simple basic rules. At higher levels, the game includes bonus points, complex dealing and other laws.\n",

From beating ourselves up for not building anything, we are suddenly building everything. Heathrow was chosen because of the extra boost it gives to the UK economy, but it is not the only mammoth project out there. After a last minute wobble, the £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power station has been given the green light, while the biggest of them all is coming down the track fast. Construction on the £42bn HS2 high-speed rail line from London to the North is scheduled to begin next year. And that is probably not all. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has hinted he may reveal some moderate government borrowing to fund targeted infrastructure spending in his Autumn Statement next month. It is enough to make the Victorians sit up and take notice. If projections for a fairly sharp post-Brexit slowdown in the economy next year are correct, we may need this spending boost. Yet if these projects proceed on time, there is something else we will need: people to build it all. With unemployment close to historic lows, it is not clear we have enough. As the Victorians did, it seems very likely we will need to look abroad to find the workers for what some say promises to be a golden age of infrastructure.

Mr Goldsmith, who will run again as an independent, has said it \"must be a referendum on Heathrow expansion\". But the likely Lib Dem candidate said Mr Goldsmith's backing for Brexit would be \"uppermost in voters' minds\". Sarah Olney, who has already been selected to fight the seat at the next General Election, said it was a \"farce\" the by-election was taking place, saying it was the result of Tory in-fighting but added that the Lib Dems were looking forward to \"putting our message in front of voters\". Ms Olney, who like Mr Goldsmith is opposed to Heathrow expansion, told the BBC's Daily Politics: \"We are on the same side as far as Heathrow is concerned, so for the voters to be able to choose between us, it's going to be fought on other issues - and I think Brexit is currently going to be the main issue that's uppermost in voters' minds.\" A local breakdown of the EU referendum results shows almost 70% of voters in the Richmond council area, which makes up the bulk of the constituency, backed Remain. Ms Olney is expected to be confirmed as the party's pick for the by-election after party leader Tim Farron rejected the idea of parachuting in one of its big names. The Conservatives are not fielding a candidate against Mr Goldsmith, who held the south-west London seat in 2015 with a 23,015 majority. The Lib Dems, who held the seat until 2010, finished second. Labour says it will field a candidate despite three of its MPs urging it to consider standing aside to maximise the chances of a Tory defeat. The Green Party said it was also likely to put forward a candidate although it said it supported \"progressives working together to beat the Conservatives\".

In fact they haven't even signed a peace treaty and in 66 years they have taken very different paths. No agreements will be signed, no joint statements made, but China's Xi Jinping and Taiwan's Ma Ying-jeou will have an hour-long meeting and a casual dinner afterwards. It could get awkward and here are some of the questions that could crop up. China has hundreds of missiles targeted at Taiwan to warn the island against declaring formal independence. Beijing still considers Taiwan a province to be reunified with the mainland one day and has not renounced the use of force to take it back. In fact, one of the main reasons for its military build-up is to counter possible US assistance to Taiwan if Beijing were to try to take back militarily. Mr. Ma would argue: \"If you want to be friends, you must remove these missiles.\" \"Not that simple,\" Mr Xi might answer. Doing so could embolden pro-independence groups in Taiwan who want the island to be recognised as a completely separate country from China. The meeting will take place less than three months before Taiwan holds presidential and legislative races, but truly democratic elections like these are not in China's vocabulary. Taiwan, on the other hand, has developed into a vibrant democracy and is proud of its system. Over dinner, Mr Ma could share his low approval rating headaches with Mr Xi and even make jokes about how hard it is to finish a speech when protesters are trying to throw shoes at him. Mr Xi might just politely smile and think to himself: \"And you wonder why we run things like we do?\" Mr Xi will be eager to push relations forward. During Mr Ma's seven years in office, the two sides have signed many agreements - from those that have allowed first-ever direct flights to ones that bring millions of Chinese tourists to Taiwan each year, not to mention tariff-cutting trade deals. China is eager to link Taiwan's economy and society even closer to the mainland's, and begin talking about unification.

The crash happened on Interstate 10 close to the resort town of Palm Springs in the early hours of Sunday morning. Investigators are examining the cause of the crash, which happened as the bus was bound for Los Angeles. Rescuers used ladders to climb into the bus windows to remove bodies. Five of the injured passengers are in critical condition. The Los Angeles Times described the crash as the deadliest in California for several decades. It said that the bus careered into the rear of the truck at high speed, mangling the front third of the bus. Most of those who died were apparently at the front of the bus, the newspaper reported. The driver was among the fatalities. Officials quoted by the paper said that identifying the victims could take days, because some were not carrying identity cards or had lost their belongings when they were taken to hospital. They have warned that it may not be possible to determine exactly why the accident happened because of the driver's death.

Details of his release are not known but a ransom was reportedly demanded. He was the latest diplomat to be kidnapped in recent months in Venezuela, which suffers from high levels of violent crime. Venezuelan Interior Minister Tarek El Aissami said via Twitter that Mr Cholele was in good shape and being taken by police to be reunited with his family. His release had been secured due to investigative work and police pressure, Mr El Aissami wrote. He said that more details on the diplomat's release would be issued later. The Costa Rican authorities had earlier said that a ransom had been demanded. It called the abduction \"extremely serious\" and said Mr Cholele needed medication for a heart condition and high blood pressure. \"For me, this kidnapping is organised crime and unfortunately Caracas is one of the most dangerous cities in the world and this is not an isolated case,\" Costa Rica's Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Roverrsi said. In January Mexican ambassador Carlos Pujalte and his wife were briefly kidnapped in Caracas before being released. Last November the Chilean consul in Caracas was abducted, beaten and shot in the leg before being released. In December, a diplomat from Belarus was also briefly kidnapped. And just last month Karen Berendique - the teenage daughter of a Chilean diplomat - was shot dead by police. Officers said she had failed to stop at a roadblock.

Reality Check verdict: What, if anything, gets cut if there is a Brexit will be a matter for the government to decide. \"If we restrict our access [to the single market] we will be less well off and that obviously affects what we can spend on our public services,\" he said. In the past few days, voters have been warned that leaving the European Union would have severe effects on different areas of public spending. We've been told both by David Cameron and Labour's Tom Watson that the triple-lock protection on state pensions would be threatened. We've had Chancellor George Osborne warning that Brexit would lead to between £1bn and £1.5bn of cuts to defence spending. He pointed out that even if the government stuck to Nato's target of spending 2% of national income on defence, if national income fell, then so would defence spending. And the prime minister has also warned about spending on the NHS being threatened if the UK left the EU. Why are they making these warnings? Because economic forecasters have said that leaving the European Union would mean the economy would grow by less than it would have done. That would mean lower tax revenues for the government, which would mean it would struggle to achieve a budget surplus as promised in 2019-20. What the government chose to do about that would be a question of policy, as David Cameron confirmed, but that has not stopped various groups having a guess. The Institute for Fiscal Studies predicted the government would decide to delay balancing the budget, bringing in an extra one or two years of austerity at the current rate. Labour In for Britain said the government would attempt to balance the budget in 2019-20, meaning it would need to make savings of £28bn, which would be divided equally between tax rises, departmental spending cuts and cuts to social security spending. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the government would be trying to save an extra £44bn in 2019-20. It is also possible that the government could decide not to balance the budget and borrow more instead. There is a pretty strong consensus that the initial economic shock from a vote to leave the EU would make it harder to achieve a balance in 2019-20, although it could be smaller than some groups have predicted.

But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with \"extreme verve and vigour.\" But one critic of the register said it was \"fake\" and full of \"loopholes\". Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions. The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics. However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working \"in-house\" for companies or organisations. A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall. But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. \"We are having something that has never been in place before,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.\" Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different \"levels of lobbying\". \"The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,\" she said. She added: \"This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain. \"If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.\" Ms White said last\n",

Silva has made 58 appearances for Monaco this season - including two against City in the Champions League - scoring 11 goals and 12 assists. He said the chance to work with Pep Guardiola influenced his decision. \"Of course when you have the opportunity of being trained by Guardiola, you don't say no,\" added the playmaker, who has played 12 times for Portugal, scoring once. \"If not the best coach in the world, he is one of the best.\" Guardiola's City finished third in the Premier League this season, securing Champions League football next year.

Former Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live I am surprised in that I think that is the one area of the pitch where they have enough options. Manchester City's attack has been sensational this season. Bernardo Silva is very similar to David Silva. I wouldn't let David Silva go, I think he's been tremendous.

So much so, in fact, that he is prepared to put him among the top five most expensive players in City history. A product of the Benfica academy, Silva is an attacking right-sided midfield player and is, at 22, just the kind of age Guardiola likes - old enough to understand his role, young enough to absorb the intricate tactical lessons his new manager imparts.

He joined ITN in 1964 and was the network's senior foreign correspondent between 1989 and 1999. He died while on a cruise with his wife Diana. ITN chief executive John Hardie said he was a \"true legend\". Nicholson, who died on 11 December, presented reports from around the world on ITV's flagship current affairs programme Tonight. He had four children and three grandchildren. He was known for smuggling an orphaned girl out of Sarajevo while reporting on the conflict - and bringing her back to the UK, where he adopted her. The correspondent met nine-year-old Natasha Mihaljcic while he was working on a story about children being trapped by shelling in the Bosnian capital in 1992. He went on to write a book about the events which was used as the inspiration for the 1997 film Welcome To Sarajevo. Nicholson was ITN's first bureau chief in South Africa in 1976 and was the first television correspondent to live in the country during apartheid. He also witnessed the toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad in 2003. Former ITN presenter Sir Trevor McDonald said Nicholson \"was almost without doubt the finest television journalist of his generation\". \"His aggressive pursuit of stories came to symbolise what the new kid on the block, as ITN then was, was all about.\" ITV News presenter Alastair Stewart said he was \"deeply saddened to learn of the death of ITN giant Mike Nicholson\".

New signing Jerome Leduc scored twice and Mike Forney got the other as the Giants took control of the contest. Mark Richardson gave Cardiff hope and Sean Bentivoglio got it back to 3-2 before Joey Haddard equalised and Patrick Asselin netted the winner. It was a devastating final period for the Giants who had hoped to cut the Devils lead to a single point. Now Derrick Walser's men must pick themselves up immediately as they host Cardiff again in Belfast on Saturday night. As befitting a clash between the top two teams, the game started at a frenetic pace which lasted the entire first period. Both keepers were kept busy but it was the Devils' Ben Bowns who was beaten first as debutant Giant Leduc, signed only this week, finished with aplomb in front of goal to give the home side the lead in the 14th minute. With 48 seconds of the period remaining, a Forney shot sneaked past the unsighted Bowns to raise the roof at the SSE Arena as the Giants snatched a two-goal advantage. Leduc's fine start in a Giants shirt continued in the second period when he slammed in his second goal of the night to make it 3-0 on a Belfast power play. The visitors were not daunted by that deficit and came back hard at the Giants with a number of impressive saves from Stephen Murphy keeping the three-goal margin intact. But there was an almighty twist in the tale. The Devils struck early in the final period as Richardson arrowed the puck into the top corner of the net past Murphy.

The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority said statutory guidance obliged it to reduce or refuse awards if victims had unspent convictions. A leading child abuse lawyer called for a review of the \"scandalous\" approach. Alan Collins said civil case judges increasingly took the opposite view, and accepted that abuse could have a lifelong effect, with addictions being a possible consequence. Since 2010, CICA - an executive agency sponsored by the Ministry of Justice - has awarded compensation to 12,665 people who were sexually abused as children, or as adults lacking mental capacity. But some 438 people have had their government-funded compensation reduced because they had committed criminal offences themselves, the BBC learned after a series of Freedom of Information requests. Of the 27 cases where compensation was reduced between June 2014 and June 2015, half were for drink, drugs, theft or property offences. Eight involved violence against people. CICA would not say how many applications by such victims had been rejected. \"The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme has always asked that awards are reduced or refused if the victim had unspent convictions,\" it said in a statement. The Ministry of Justice said the refusal or reduction of an awarded payment reflected the fact the individual \"may have caused distress, loss or injury to another person, and cost the taxpayer money through a police investigation or court proceedings\". It said there were no plans to review the scheme. Odette Tovey, a Sheffield-based legal representative for several grooming victims whose applications have been rejected by CICA, said: \"The crimes committed against the victims far outweigh the crimes that these victims committed.\" Some of these had been abused for many years, from their early teens, added Ms Tovey, and CICA was their only route to potential compensation. Ms Tovey said CICA needed to take into consideration that victims' crimes \"were as a result of mental health problems developed because of the period of abuse they went through\". Victims could be eligible for compensation of £27,000 if no deductions were made, said Ms Tovey. The average award after CICA compensation reduction was £8,423.

Marshall is widely regarded as their star player and Giles, who had two playing stints with the club lasting a combined total of six years, is unhappy at the player leaving. \"I think it's a joke. Personally I think David Marshall is worth £8m, probably more than that to any club,\" said Giles before Marshall's move was finalised. \"Football today, I hate it, all these stats - they keep going on with stats, but if you look at Marshall's stats, they would without a doubt be better than anyone in the Championship and be a lot better than goalkeepers in the Premier League and they've let him go. \"Probably if Hull win the Premier League they'll get £5m.\" \"They are going to get £3.5m and they're selling him on the cheap. And that tells me where the club is going: nowhere.\" Giles agrees that Cardiff City need a proven goalscorer, but does not believe one will be signed. \"Without a doubt Cardiff need a striker and talking to fans, they're looking for someone to score 15-20 goals a season,\" he told Radio Wales Sport. \"Well that's not going to happen this year and unfortunately we're looking at a season where if they finish half way, they've done well. \"Is that going to bring your fans back? You'll always get your diehards going, but is that going to get enthusiastic people coming down to Cardiff City Stadium? \"It's a poor Cardiff City when they're watching second-rate football.\"\n",

Chris, who works as an electrical wholesaler, strongly believes it was a trip that saved his life. \"I was one of the fortunate ones, just so lucky when I think about it,\" he said. Chris initially thought he may have had an ulcer and was not concerned. \"My health was fine, I was a 40-something rugby player. I worked shifts and thought any tiredness was down to an unusual sleep pattern.\" But after receiving a pinprick test at his local blood clinic in Ballymoney, nurses told Chris that he could not donate blood because his iron levels were unusually low and advised him to visit his local GP who then referred him for a colonoscopy. Chris was then diagnosed with GIST, a rare cancer that occurs in the wall of the stomach and small intestine. Doctors discovered the 9cm (3.5in) tumour in March 2013 and carried out a successful operation at the Royal Victoria Hospital in May. \"I tried to keep things as normal as I could at home, I have two young girls. Thankfully the cancer didn't spread. I had surgery to remove my stomach. I was 16 stone (100kg) before surgery, now I'm 12 stone (79kg). The Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service (NIBTS) has shared Chris' story on their Facebook page, describing it as a \"story with a difference\".

Adams and his Oklahoma City Thunder side beat Golden State Warriors 118-94 in game four of the Western Conference finals on Tuesday, to lead last year's champions 3-1 in the best-of-seven series. It was the first back-to back defeats for the Warriors this season, a team who set a new NBA record of 73 wins in the regular season. Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were the stars of the show for the Thunder, but even they were eclipsed by a moment of magic from Adams. The 22-year-old, who scored 11 points and seven rebounds in the win, threw a one-handed bullet pass to Andre Roberson just before half-time. More than 22,000 tweets were sent in an hour about Adams' baseball style throw and the player began trending on Twitter in his native New Zealand and the US. Then there was a young fan who turned up to the game at Oklahoma's Chesapeake Arena, dressed as Adams with a fake moustache and tattoos in tribute to her hero. Many Twitter users felt the youngster was the real star of game four and even Adams himself tweeted that it was \"absolutely amazing\". In game three Adams hit the headlines after Warriors forward Draymond Green kicked him in the groin area, but avoided suspension. It led to Thunder fans using the hashtag #standupforsteven in the build-up to Tuesday's game. Adams has rarely been out of the headlines in the series. After game one he had to apologise for referring to the Warriors' players as \"quick little monkeys\". \"It was just a poor choice of words,\" said Adams, who blamed differences in dialect for his comments. \"I wasn't thinking straight.

Liverpool also beat Everton 4-0 on Wednesday and are two points behind West Ham in seventh. Watford remain 12th and will now focus on Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley against Palace. Both sides have had their fill of penalty action this week. Carroll scored one for the Hammers before they conceded a late spot-kick and equaliser against Leicester on Sunday. And Watford earned a 1-0 victory over West Brom on Saturday - their first win in seven league games - largely thanks to Heurelho Gomes' two penalty saves. However, Gomes was not able to save his side for a third and fourth time in 135 minutes of play. Noble slotted both penalties home with ease, after Carroll had given the Hammers the lead by poking in from close range after a pinpoint ball from Dimitri Payet. Watford got in on the action late on, when Angelo Ogbonna was adjudged to have brought down goalscorer Prodl in the area, but Deeney - on as a second-half substitute - was denied by Adrian. West Ham came up against a much-changed Watford side, as manager Quique Sanchez Flores kept seven first-team players rested for Sunday's trip to Wembley.

It was one of a cocktail of drugs used by Aaron Strong, 19, and Aaron Fox, 16. 'With Lyrica, I see people running about like zombies' An ex-drug user, who lost his teenage friend to suicide after a battle with drugs, has told BBC News NI that abuse of Lyrica is \"wrecking lives\". The Belfast teenager, who spoke anonymously, said he first took the drug when he was 16 and that it is freely available in his community. Read more on his story here. It is illegal to have class C drugs without a prescription and illegal to supply or sell them to others. The Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs made the recommendation in a letter to ministers, including the then home secretary Theresa May, in January. The letter cited warnings from the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) who highlighted \"significant misuse and abuse\" of the drug. Pregabalin is known as \"bud\" or \"Budweisers\" by recreational users because it is makes them feel the same high as if they were drunk.

But it's going to be a bit trickier to see them this year because it's happening at the same time as a supermoon - the third one this year. The light from the closer full moon will make it harder for stargazers. Meteors are small space rocks ranging from the size of a grain of sand to a pea that enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, producing a bright streak of light. Most meteors break off from comets, which are dirty \"snowballs\" mainly made of ice, but the Geminids are different. The object they come from, the 3200 Phaethon, is more like an asteroid. As it orbits, the heat of the Sun causes surface material to crumble, before it tumbles off into space, leaving a trail of rocky debris behind it. The Earth passes through this trail each year as it orbits around the Sun, and we see them glow as the rock burns up in the Earth's atmosphere. You don't need any special equipment to view the meteor shower. Find a clear space away from street lights or the light coming from your house. Give your eyes enough time to adjust to the dark, and look up. Hopefully, with clear skies, you will be able to spot them as they blaze across the night sky.\n",

The company also forecast higher-than-expected holiday season revenue of between $76bn and $78bn. But revenue in the fourth quarter fell 9% to $46.85bn. That meant annual revenue fell for the first time since 2001, highlighting a slowdown in the smartphone market as well as intensifying competition, particularly from Chinese rivals. Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC Technology correspondent It was no surprise that Apple saw its first fall in annual revenues for 15 years. It became apparent earlier in the year that sales of the iPhone - surely the most profitable product in history - had plateaued and they continued to disappoint this quarter. It was hard to spot any product or market delivering outstanding results - the fact that Apple still hasn't released any figures for its Watch tells its own story - and the 30% fall in China sales looked particularly worrying. But somehow Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook still managed to paint a rosy picture. He pointed to the 24% rise in income from services like Apple Music and Apple Pay. He told us that he was thrilled with the response of customers to the iPhone 7 - and that round the world, including in China, demand was outstripping supply. And crucially he looked forward to a return to growth in the next quarter, with Apple forecasting a record-breaking holiday season. Investors have been looking for reasons to buy back into Apple and that prediction may help continue the recent upward path of the shares. But the technology crowd is still waiting for some radical new innovation, to prove the company founded by Steve Jobs hasn't lost its creative spark. Tim Cook wouldn't be drawn when quizzed about moves into TV or building a car or a connected speaker like the Amazon Echo. He did say \"we have the strongest product pipeline we've ever had\". But that is a line we have been hearing for some time. Apple executives said demand for the new iPhone 7 was strong, despite fiscal fourth-quarter revenue falls in China and the Americas, its two most important markets.

The Court of Appeal suggested the Department for Work and Pensions would owe a mere 1% of that amount, £1.3m, to just 2,500 people. The complex judgment on Friday was originally prompted by a challenge from Cait Reilly, a geology graduate from Birmingham. She had argued that requiring her to work at Poundland for no pay constituted a breach of her human rights. The government - to counter such claims - had retrospectively altered the law to validate the docking of benefits. Today, the Court of Appeal ruled that even under that new revised law, the docking of benefits could be incompatible with the European Convention of Human Rights. The Court's ruling represented a defeat for the government. Padraig Hughes, of Public Interest Lawyers, the group that brought Ms Reilly's case, said: \"It is yet a further example of the reckless approach this Government continues to take towards the constitution and the rule of law.\" The Court of Appeal judges did nevertheless acknowledge that government ministers can change laws to affect cases retrospectively. And the judges decided that the only rights infringed upon where those of people that had already claimed the benefits docking was unfair. This narrowing of the claimants explains why only a tiny fraction of people will be eligible for a payout. \"We are considering the judgment\", a DWP spokesman said. \"It is only right that jobseekers do all they can to find work while claiming benefits.\" It is not clear yet whether either side will make a further appeal.\n",

The vote is not binding on MPs but Jeremy Corbyn has said the party must heed the opinion of members. It follows calls from a senior Labour figure for a free vote in Parliament. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told a meeting hosted by The Guardian at the Labour conference that Syria and the renewal of Trident were issues on which he did not expect consensus within the party and he believed a vote on military action in Syria should be made \"on the basis of conscience\". The government was defeated in 2013 in a parliamentary vote on military action in Syria, but ministers have since said the case for UK intervention in the country should be made again. In 2014 MPs voted in favour of RAF air strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq. Labour's new leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for a UN security council resolution and a fresh diplomatic push to end the violence in Syria. The Labour conference will also consider an emergency motion, tabled by the union Unite, opposing the extension of the RAF's campaign against IS into Syria without \"clear and unambiguous\" authorisation from the UN.

The agency said Skye was known as Scotland's \"Dinosaur Isle\" because of its important fossil records. SNH has appealed for witnesses to contact the police. Skye is a key dinosaur fossil site in Scotland. Bearreraig Bay, north of Portree, is within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A crowbar is suspected to have been used to prise away some of the rock. Dinosaur footprints may also have been removed from Valtos on Skye, SNH said. Evidence gathered at Valtos has been used by palaeontologists to explain what has been called the Dino Stampede in Australia, an incident where a group of dinosaurs were pursued by a predator. SNH said the Bearreraig Bay dig had been done without the landowner's permission or the consent of SNH, which manages the SSSI. Dr Colin MacFadyen, SNH's geologist, also said the actions went against guidelines in the Scottish Fossil Code. The codes does allow for the use of mechanical diggers, rock saws and even explosives for extracting fossils, but only when it was to the benefit of palaeontological research. Dr MacFadyen said: \"Fossil collecting is important for scientific and educational purposes, and is a popular hobby. \"It is better for fossils that fall from cliffs to be found, collected and enjoyed rather than be eroded and washed away by the tide. \"However, speeding up the process by large scale rock removal as in this alarming case is irresponsible and illegal, and also potentially dangerous to people as the cliff faces are undermined and destabilised.\" Dr MacFadyen said permission to remove material from the SSSI would have been needed from SNH, but it had not been sought.

Mayor Olaf Scholz said the attack was motivated by \"hate\" but did not say it was a terror attack. There are unconfirmed reports that the man shouted \"Allahu akhbar\", Arabic for \"God is great\" while attacking people. Police said they were still seeking to confirm his current nationality. Mr Sholz said he was a failed asylum seeker. The man attacked customers in the supermarket at random, ran outside and was chased by customers and by people outside the shop. They brought him to the ground before he was detained by plain-clothes police officers.

A 50-year-old woman and four men aged between 19 and 64 were stabbed, while a 35-year-old man was injured while helping overcome the suspect. The attack happened in the Barmbek region in the north of the city in a branch of Edeka, Germany's largest supermarket chain. Police say the man's weapon may have looked like a machete but they are, for now, assuming it was a kitchen knife.

We are investigating all avenues.\" Speculation in German media said the attack may have been part of a robbery attempt but police said that that motive could not be confirmed.

            "Input: summarize: The claim: \"We are giving £20bn a year or £350m a week to Brussels.\" Reality Check verdict: We are not giving £20bn a year or £350m a week to Brussels - Britain pays £276m a week to the EU budget because of the rebate. He has gone with that figure despite a letter from the head of the UK statistics watchdog Sir Andrew Dilnot on Thursday, which described it as \"potentially misleading\". The figure used is roughly the UK's gross contribution to the EU - the amount that would be contributed to the EU Budget were it not for the rebate. We say \"roughly the UK's gross contribution\" because the annual figure that Boris Johnson used was £20bn, somewhat higher than the £18.8bn figure for 2014 - the most recent figure available - while the £350m a week figure is a bit below the actual figure of £361m. The important point is that it's not the sum we send to Brussels because the rebate is deducted before any money is paid. In 2014, the UK's contribution to the EU budget - the amount we paid to Brussels - was actually £276m a week. If Britain were to give up the rebate, then the UK would have to pay the gross contribution, and it should be noted that the rebate is not a permanent feature of Britain's membership of the EU. But we do not pay the gross contribution at the moment, the rebate is safe until 2020, and Britain has a veto over the process that would remove or reduce it. Sir Andrew Dilnot is particularly concerned about suggestions from Vote Leave that a sum of money equivalent to the gross contribution could be spent on other priorities such as the NHS, when some of it is not spent at all (the rebate) and some of it is currently used to support UK farmers, for example.

            "Input: summarize: Abel Hernandez was the hero for the hosts, scoring twice on his first start since injuring his groin against Southampton on 6 November. That match against the Saints was the final league victory under Silva's predecessor Mike Phelan, who was dismissed on 3 January with the team bottom of the league. Hull have now won twice in three games under former Olympiakos and Sporting Lisbon boss Silva, having beaten Swansea in the FA Cup third round a week ago. Tyrone Mings' own goal added gloss to the scoreline for Hull, who took a long time to grow into the match after falling behind to Junior Stanislas' third-minute penalty, awarded for Harry Maguire's challenge on Ryan Fraser and the 10th the Tigers have conceded in 21 games this season. Bournemouth have now shipped three goals in eight of their last 10 games in all competitions, and drop to 11th place after their 10th defeat of the campaign. It has been a bleak winter for Hull so far and the loss of £10m striker Hernandez to injury certainly contributed to their plight. The Tigers went nine games without a win during his absence, dropping them to the bottom of the table by Christmas and culminating in the departure of Phelan early in the new year. His return has coincided with the appointment of Silva, and it has quickly become apparent that the influence of both could prove vital in turning Hull's season around. The 26-year-old's goal against Swansea in the cup was a timely reminder of the ability that brought him 20 goals in Hull's promotion campaign last season, and his first against Bournemouth bore all the predatory instincts that the hosts have been missing these past few weeks. Huge credit must go to Andrew Robertson for the quality of his cross from the left wing, which presented Hernandez with a headed chance from around a yard out that he simply could not miss. The second was more of a self-made effort, the Uruguay international picking the ball up on the right, advancing into the area and selling a couple of cute stepovers to Mings before curling a precise finish into the left-hand corner.

Since coming back to Shropshire the goals have flowed, leading Shrewsbury boss Micky Mellon to question why he has not been part of the England Under-21 squad. Ogogo, who is wearing the armband in the absence of suspended Nat Knight-Percival, thinks Kaikai has improved since he was last at the club. \"He's always played well but he's now adding goals to his game,\" said Ogogo. Kaikai's 11th strike of the season put Town ahead league leaders against Wigan last Saturday before the title challengers hit back in style to win 5-1. But Ogogo is staying confident over their survival chances despite having to play four sides currently in the top six in their next five games. \"One defeat in 10 games isn't bad - we've been on a good run so we need to dust ourselves down and go again,\" said Ogogo. \"We've got a tough run-in bit we can't look at other teams.\"\n",

And Cairney found the only goal of the game, picking up the ball on the edge of the box and rifling a low shot into the back of the net. The first real piece of action was for the visitors and their front man Stephen Dobbie. He won the ball from Peter Murphy, but he dragged his shot wide of the target. Minutes later Mark Millar tried his luck for Queens, but his shot was saved by the legs of Greg Fleming in the Ayr goal. The next clear cut chance came just before the half time whistle. Jordan Marshall slipped away from his marker, he whipped in a great ball from the left, but Dobbie couldn't get his head to it. The breakthrough came in the second half with Cairney's goal, and Ayr could have doubled their lead through Gary Harkins. The striker had time, but failed to get the shot on target and launched the ball over the bar. Ayr United move up to sixth spot in the Championship, with Queens now down to third after their second defeat in a row. Match ends, Ayr United 1, Queen of the South 0.

A \"small group\" conspired for four months, the officials said. Chad, a staunch ally of France, has a long history of coups and revolts. Mr Deby himself seized power in a coup in 1990. The BBC's Nathalie Magnien in N'Djamena says it is business as usual in the capital and no-one seems particularly concerned about the news. There is no visible sign of increased security in the city or patrols on the streets, she says. \"Between four and eight people were killed in fighting at a military barracks in the east of N'Djamena,\" said a police source who requested anonymity, Reuters news agency reports. By Celeste HicksFormer BBC Chad correspondent Chadians are used to news of suspected coups - power has never changed hands peacefully and President Idriss Deby Itno is constantly aware that a soldier or even someone in his own family could overthrow him. It is not yet clear who was behind this \"attempt at destabilisation\". Government sources say the main figure arrested is Saleh Makki, a hitherto relatively unknown member of the political opposition with no association with rebels in the past. Some are speculating that there may be a connection to Chad's recent military interventions abroad and President Deby recently accused Libya of supporting militias against him. Recent threats from the former Chadian rebel group UFR do not carry much weight as they are a spent force.

A bus filled with a wedding party taking the bride to the groom's home was stopped at a routine checkpoint on 12 February near the southern Ethiopian town of Shashamane. Local police told revellers to turn off the nationalistic Oromo music playing. They refused and the bus drove off. The situation then rapidly escalated and reports indicate at least one person died and three others were injured after police fired shots. The exact details of the incident are hard to verify, but what is clear is that days of protest followed, including armed local militia clashing with federal police, leaving seven policemen dead, the government says. Oromia at a glance: Why Ethiopia is making a historic ‘master plan’ U-turn Since last November, Ethiopia has seen a third phase of the recent unrest in the Oromia region which has been unprecedented in its longevity and geographical spread. The region is the largest in Ethiopia and the Oromos, who make up a third of the population, are the biggest of the country's more than 80 ethnic groups. Initially the protests were in reaction to a plan to expand the administrative border of the capital, Addis Ababa, which is encircled by Oromia. But even after the region's governing party, the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation, which is part of Ethiopia's governing coalition, shelved the plan in January, protests have continued. \"There is a strong sense of victimhood, extending back 150 years,\" says Daniel Berhane, a prominent Addis Ababa-based political blogger, covering Ethiopia for the website Horn Affairs. \"People remember the history. The scars are still alive, such as how the Oromo language was suppressed until 20 years ago.\" Despite there being an ethnic basis to these protests, observers say that the deeper issues behind them, frustrations over land ownership, corruption, political and economic marginalisation, are familiar to many disenchanted Ethiopians. The numbers killed since November following clashes between protesters and security forces given by international rights organisations, activists and observers range from 80 to 250.

Specialist teams are also turning away up to a quarter of youngsters, it said. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government was \"determined to address\" mental health problems. The previous coalition government promised in 2015 an extra £250m a year during this parliament to improve mental health services for children in England. However, Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb - who was a health minister at the time - has now overseen a report by an independent commission that says much of the money has failed to reach the areas where it is most needed. The report - by the Education Policy Institute Independent Commission on Children and Young People's Mental Health - says only £75m made it to the clinical commissioning groups who pay for services last year. The commission says young people are still struggling to access help - partly because of difficulties in recruiting staff, including mental health nurses and psychiatrists. According to the report, specialist services are turning away 23% of children and young people referred to them, often because there are \"high thresholds\" for accessing services. The authors warned that \"something has to go drastically wrong before some services will intervene\". The report challenged Theresa May to develop a \"prime minister's challenge on children's mental health\", similar to former PM David Cameron's \"dementia challenge\", which led to increases in investment and awareness. Mr Lamb, chairman of the commission, said: \"The prime minister, in her very first speech, rightly highlighted the inadequacies of the country's mental health provision as a 'burning injustice'. \"Today we call on the government to meet this commitment - and take urgent action to ensure children and young people with mental health problems receive the care they need.\" Bev Humphrey, chairwoman of the Mental Health Network - which represents mental health and learning disability service providers in England - said the government had failed \"to come close to fulfilling its existing promises on mental health funding\". \"This situation means underfunded NHS and social services are struggling to help the growing number of children experiencing serious mental health problems. \"With many services almost at breaking point the commission is right - it really is time to deliver.\" Mr Hunt said mental health services for children remained\n",

Johnnie Jackson wasted a good opening as the Charlton captain headed over Johann Berg Gudmundsson's cross. And Charlton's Simon Makienok missed two late chances as Cardiff hung on. The Bluebirds were reduced to 10 men for the final minute of injury time after midfielder Sammy Ameobi was dismissed for a second yellow card. The point moves Charlton off the bottom table but they are now six points from safety after MK Dons and Bristol City both won. It was a battle of the sides with controversial owners and in a week where Vincent Tan vowed to halve Cardiff's £140m debt, Charlton fans handed out 2,000 Pinocchio masks and stickers before kick-off in the latest protest at Addicks owner Roland Duchatelet. And their mood would not have been helped if Anthony Pilkington's header had not been deflected over with barely a minute on the clock. Ameobi and a Peter Whittingham free-kick went close for Cardiff before midfielder Ralls' 25-yard shot cannoned back off the post. Charlton's Reza Ghoochannejhad tested Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall before an unmarked Jackson headed Gudmundsson's corner into the ground and over. Pilkington twice worried the Charton defence either side of the interval before the Cardiff striker hit the crossbar when his clever flick from Scott Malone's cross had home keeper Stephen Henderson beaten. But Charlton, with the second worst defensive record in the league, held firm and the hosts could have won their first home game since early November in added time.

He was once an ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan but has now been accused of plotting to overthrow the Turkish government - a claim the cleric strongly denies. The US is thought to be unlikely to act on any extradition request. The move comes amid a national crackdown on perceived supporters of the cleric. Over 20 journalists working for media outlets thought to be sympathetic to the Gulen movement were arrested last weekend. Eight of them were freed on Friday on the orders of a court in Istanbul. Those released include Ekrem Dumanli, editor-in-chief of Zaman newspaper. Four others, including a TV station boss, remain in custody. According to the BBC's Mark Lowen in Istanbul, it was expected that the authorities would go after Mr Gulen after having targeted those linked to him. While the US and Turkey have an extradition agreement, the warrant is considered to be largely symbolic - and unlikely to be acted upon. The relationship between Washington and Ankara has grown fractious, though they remain allies. Mr Erdogan has faced criticism from international leaders and his opponents, who accuse him of authoritarianism and undermining free press. Many abroad believe that the charges against Mr Gulen are politically motivated. The wealthy cleric, who operates an international network of schools and businesses, has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999.

But there was support for the idea of more powers being devolved to the Welsh Assembly, with 49% in favour. ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,006 people in Wales over the telephone. The survey found 12% wanted to see the assembly abolished. The poll also found growing support for UKIP in Wales ahead of next year's general election. Nigel Farage's party is on 14%, up seven points from the last BBC Wales poll in March. Labour are down four points to 38%, with the Conservatives on 23% (down one), Plaid Cymru on 13% (down one) and the Liberal Democrats on 7% (down two). Prof Roger Scully of the Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University said: \"Support for independence is the lowest I've seen anywhere. \"There has been a clear move towards supporting more powers, and some of the people who may have said 'independence' have gone in that direction. \"We're getting close to a majority saying they want things to go further. There are also pretty low levels of support for abolition of the assembly - the extreme positions are losing out.\" An analysis of the voting intention figures by Prof Scully suggests that, on a uniform swing, Labour would gain two seats in the capital - Cardiff North and Cardiff Central - at next May's general election. The Conservatives would lose Cardiff North but gain Brecon and Radnor; Plaid Cymru would retain their three seats but the Liberal Democrats would be reduced to a solitary Welsh seat at Westminster - Ceredigion. UKIP's level of support is too low to win their own seat, but high enough to have an impact on some marginal constituencies. \"UKIP's support is clearly going up,\" said Prof Scully. \"They are starting to reach the sort of level where they could make a serious difference in marginal seats.\" He said most evidence suggests they are taking more support from the Conservatives than anywhere else, which could be of importance in Tory-held marginal seats like the Vale of Glamorgan and Aberconwy.

A senior IS leader was also said to have been killed east of the city. Government forces have encircled Ramadi and are preparing for a final assault on the city, which IS overran in May. Last week, troops retook the key western district of Tamim, which is only separated from the city centre by a tributary of the Euphrates, and the headquarters of the Iraqi military's Anbar Operations Command. On Monday, a senior source in the Anbar Operations Command said IS militants launched a wave of attacks across Ramadi as they tried to regain areas recently recaptured by government forces. Five suicide bombers drove cars packed with explosives at government positions, including those in the northern district of Albu Farraj, killing more than 20 soldiers and tribesmen, the source added. At least 15 militants were subsequently killed in a gun battle, before Iraqi and US-led air strikes forced the rest of the attackers to retreat. A sixth suicide car bomb attack, in south-western Ramadi, killed another 15 soldiers and tribesmen, the source said. Iraqi media also reported that an IS leader in charge of setting up car bombs had been killed along with four of his aides in a military operation in the Jazirat al-Khalidiya area, 12 miles (20km) east of Ramadi. Security sources identified the militant as Ibrahim al-Halabi, a Syrian national. The US military believes there are between 600 and 1,000 IS militants in Ramadi. It says they have developed a strong defensive system in and around the city, including using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to create minefields.\n",

Power was restored to Adelaide area by 03:00 local time (17:30 GMT) but tens of thousands of homes remain cut off. On Thursday, authorities advised people to leave work early as winds were expected to intensify again. How 'unprecedented' storm played out The state premier said \"twin tornadoes\" had hit northern areas in \"an extreme weather event\" on Wednesday. Jay Weatherill compared the storm to Hurricane Sandy which hit New York in 2012. He said officials in charges of the power grid had told him \"any system would not be able to cope with a weather system of this kind\". \"We had winds which were so strong that when they hit power lines they created such energy they were tearing the towers out of the ground.\" While South Australia's wild weather was widely forecast, no-one could really predict the impact it would have on everyday life. In Adelaide, commuters were left feeling their way in the dark as the lights went off on their way home. Gridlock followed, as trains and trams came to a standstill. At the airport, some passengers had to depend on handwritten boarding passes, after power for the printers failed. Some describe the whole experience as \"apocalyptic\", while one woman, who was on the operating table in the local hospital and about to undergo surgery, said it was simply \"funny\". What has been predictable is that an extreme weather event has very quickly turned into an Australian political storm, with the state's dependency on renewable energy now being debated with the full force and bluster of a tornado. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said the storm was a once-in-50-years event. It is forecasting further heavy rainfall throughout Thursday and into Friday. Further gales of up to 140km/h (87mph) are expected, and flood warnings remain in place. On Thursday, South Australia's State Emergency Service has warned residents to prepare for more high winds and rain, cautioning there was \"a potentially very dangerous\" weather system gathering, with winds of up to 125km/h (78mph) predicted. \"As the winds increase, rainfall intensity is also expected to increase,\" said Chief Officer Chris Beattie. \"High tide\n",

Officials say strong winds and heavy rains caused the crane to fall. Correspondents say there have previously been concerns about safety on Saudi construction sites. The Grand Mosque, known as the Masjid al-Haram, is the largest mosque in the world and surrounds Islam's holiest place, the Kaaba. At least 230 people were injured in the incident. It is unclear how many people were hurt by the collapse or the stampede that followed it. Those killed are reported to include Indonesian, Indian, Iranian and Egyptian citizens. The incident happened at 17:23 local time (14:23 GMT) on Friday. Videos posted online showed the moment the structure collapsed, with a loud crash followed by panic and shouting. Bodies and blood could be seen on the floor of the mosque. The head of Saudi Arabia's civil defence agency, Lt Sulayman Bin-Abdullah al-Amr, said an investigation was being carried out to assess the damage, and the \"extent of the safety of these sites\". Essam al-Ghalib, a Jeddah-based journalist, said the crane fell through the outer ring of the Grand Mosque and punctured through the roof sending down tonnes of cement and debris onto people either praying or walking through. Up to two million people are expected to arrive in Mecca for the Hajj from all over the world later this month. Saudi officials say the crane disaster will not prevent the Hajj going ahead. Irfan Al-Alawi, from the Islamic Heritage Research Foundation, told the BBC that the Grand Mosque is currently surrounded by 15 large cranes amid major redevelopment work. \"The entire area is like a salvage yard,\" Mr Al-Alawi said. \"Saudi Arabia has to re-think its health and safety strategy,\" he said, \"as there were 800,000 people in the mosque area at the time of the accident.\" The original parts of the Grand Mosque date back 1,400 years.

However, the service at Jasenovac was boycotted by Jewish and Serb groups. They say the new Croat government has not acted against renewed use of Ustashe salutes by nationalists. In January, ultra-nationalists shouted pro-Nazi slogans at a rally attended by thousands of people, including Deputy Parliamentary Speaker Ivan Tepes. Similar slogans were also chanted during a football match between Israel and Croatia in March, attended by Prime Minister Tihomir Oreskovic. Croatia's Jewish community held a separate Holocaust commemoration a week ago. Mr Oreskovic and President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic both voiced regret over the boycott. Earlier this month they explicitly condemned the Ustashe regime's crimes for the first time during a visit by Nicholas Dean, the US State Department's special envoy for Holocaust issues.

It speaks of Britain's \"almost moribund political culture\". Conservative MP Conor Burns said the letter was \"naive\", but David Cameron said he welcomed the move. The 52-page letter - an unprecedented intervention by the House of Bishops - says \"it is the duty of every Christian adult to vote, even though it may have to be a vote for something less than a vision that inspires us\". The Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham James, said there was \"disengagement with the contemporary political culture\" and rejected the pleas of some, such as comedian and actor Russell Brand, for people not to vote. He told reporters: \"We as bishops are not as sexy as Russell Brand but we say 'do vote, do engage and do use the hard-won political freedoms that you possess'.\" The letter says the country needs \"a new approach to political life that will change the political weather as decisively as did the administrations of 1945 and 1979\". \"The ideals that the Big Society stood for should not be consigned to the political dustbin,\" the letter adds. The Big Society was among the Conservatives' flagship 2010 election policies and encouraged greater personal responsibility and community activism in shaping society and running public services. But by January 2013 charities expressed \"huge frustration\" at a lack of progress with the idea, which they said appeared to be \"going nowhere\". The document covers various issues including: The bishops are well aware that their pre-election letter will be seen by some as a left-wing document - although they have been at pains to stress that their intention is not to back one party over another, nor to create a wish-list of policies - although they do ask voters to back the \"living wage\". They say that the two UK administrations that offered genuinely new visions - Clement Attlee's Labour party in 1945 and Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives in 1979 - changed the way people in Britain looked at society, politics and the role of government and human relationships - but that today, neither vision addresses contemporary needs, at a time of increasing public alienation from mainstream politics.

Protesters lost their appeal to the Supreme Court earlier this month. Transport Minister Keith Brown said the \"unwanted delays\" had resulted in a \"substantial increase\" in the overall cost of the project. William Walton from the protest group RoadSense, which spearheaded the legal challenge against the construction of the bypass, told BBC Scotland he believed the total cost could be even higher. It is anticipated that construction will get under way in 2014, with completion by spring 2018. In answer to a parliamentary question lodged by Aberdeen Central SNP MSP Kevin Stewart, Mr Brown said the scheme had been costed at £347m in 2008 - an estimate based on 2003 prices. He said that the figure had now risen to £653m as a result of \"scope changes, the inclusion of standard risk costs and rebasing to 2012 prices\". Mr Brown said inflation had been responsible for a £230m increase in the cost. A scheme to make the A90 a dual carriageway between Balmedie and Tipperty in Aberdeenshire is also expected to cost £92m, giving a total of £745m for the combined project. Mr Stewart criticised the added costs caused by the legal challenges. He said: \"Not only has an essential piece of infrastructure been delayed unnecessarily, but inflation has driven up costs. \"Now that the legal challenges have been exhausted, we can now move towards construction as quickly as possible.\" Aberdeen City Council leader Barney Crockett said: \"We realised that the cost of the AWPR (Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route) would be roughly what it now is and we have made adequate provision for that. \"The economic performance of the area will be underpinned by the AWPR.\" Tom Smith, chairman of Aberdeen City and Shire Economic Future (Acsef) business development agency, said: \"The delays caused by the legal challenges were always going to impact on the costs outlined in 2003. \"However, the economic and other benefits of the road are so significant that the cost will still represent a major return on investment for the public purse and people of the north east. \"The final mechanics of how they will\n",

Mr Osborne questioned the wisdom of quoting backbenchers in a dig at the unrest in Labour ranks. He also pledged £50m in flood relief. Mr Cameron is attempting to secure reforms to the UK's relationship with the EU before holding an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. Ms Eagle, who was greeted with loud cheers as she stood up at the despatch box, said Mr Cameron had been \"jetting all over the place\" on his \"seemingly endless European tour\", adding to laughter from Labour ranks: \"Can I ask the chancellor: How's it all going?\" \"The good news is we have a leader who is respected abroad,\" replied Mr Osborne, saying the PM was \"fighting for a better deal for Britain, something that would never have happened had there been a Labour government\". George Osborne, the bookies' favourite to replace David Cameron as Conservative leader, was then asked whether he really aspired to be \"the first post-EU prime minister\" by Ms Eagle, who quoted some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs as being \"pretty unimpressed by how it's going\". She then imitated Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's PMQs approach of reading out questions from emails he has received. In this case it was \"Donald from Brussels\" - a reference to EU Council president Donald Tusk, who warned of the \"destabilising\" effect of uncertainty over the UK's future in Europe in a letter to fellow EU leaders this week.

There have been concerns in the past that the region was missing out despite major investment in broadband.

One critic said it did not stop the \"cycle of crime\", however, the National Police Chiefs' Council said it was \"a cost effective tactic\". A Home Office spokesman said it was \"an operational matter for police\". Informants can get anything from a few pounds for basic information, up to several thousand pounds for helping break up organised crime. Payments are typically used to solve - or prevent - crimes including murder, terrorism and serious sexual offences, and can also be made to recover valuable stolen items. Ronnie Howard, a former undercover police officer, said he made regular payments to informants, and in one case paid out £15,000 over 12 months in order to recover £3m worth of cannabis. He said informants were usually recruited after being arrested and offered either money or a possible sentencing deal in court in return for information supplied. Figures obtained by 5 live Breakfast, under a freedom of information request revealed 41 forces in England and Wales collectively paid £19.59m to informants between 2011 and 2016. The Police Service of Northern Ireland spent almost £2m during the same period while Police Scotland, who only released figures for 2013-16, revealed it had spent £565,248. There are no statistics available to show how many convictions have come as a result of paying informants - or covert human intelligence sources as they are officially known - but the National Police Chiefs' Council defended the practice. Deputy Chief Constable Roger Bannister said: \"The intelligence provided helps to prevent and solve the most serious of crimes and is vital in bringing offenders to justice through the courts. \"This is a well-established and highly regulated, worthwhile, and cost effective tactic, with the money paid to informants being very closely scrutinised.\" But, Neil Wood, who worked as an undercover police officer and ran many informants, said the tactic has its limitations. \"It can be effective for certain crimes but for others - such as the war on drugs - using informants merely ensures that the cycle of violence and brutality continues,\" he said. \"Nobody wants to inform on the drug lords because of fears of violent reprisals, so it's only the low-lying fruit that gets caught out -\n",

So how did this final half hour unfold? Germanwings flight 4U 9525 took off from Barcelona Airport in Spain heading for Duesseldorf, Germany, with 150 people on board, at 09:00 GMT on 24 March. The Airbus 320 began travelling over the sea towards France, taking about half an hour to climb to 38,000ft (11,600m). It should have been a two-hour flight and, in the first 20 minutes, the pilots could be heard discussing the stop-over at Barcelona with a flight attendant. At 09:30 the plane made its final contact with air traffic control - a routine message about permission to continue on its route. Everything seemed to be going as planned. Shortly afterwards, the captain told the co-pilot he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications. The cockpit door is heard opening and closing on the recording. Seconds later, shortly before 09:31, the selected altitude was changed from 38,000 ft to 100 ft and the plane began its descent. At 09:33, the plane's speed increased. Air traffic control contacted the co-pilot - and continued to do so over the coming minutes - but received no answer. A buzzer requesting access to the cockpit sounded at 09:34. Knocking and muffled voices asking for the door to be opened can be heard until the end of the recording. At 09:39, \"noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions\" over the course of a minute. The flight crew of another plane also tried to make contact with the cockpit by radio around this time. In the next minute - 93 seconds before impact - \"low amplitude inputs\" on the co-pilot's flight controls were recorded. But the level of movement was too low to disengage the autopilot, so the input made no change to the flight path.

One of the attackers filmed the assault on Samiul Alam Rajon on Wednesday on his mobile phone, while the others tied the boy to a pole and hit him repeatedly with a metal rod. He screamed for help, the Daily Star reported, and cried for water as he begged for his life. The men can be heard laughing and jeering at him as they told him that they would post the video on Facebook. After the boy was killed, the attackers took his body to a secluded dump, the paper reported, about 600ft (180m) away from the torture spot. But they were spotted by some locals who chased them. Three of the group escaped, but one man was caught and handed over to the police. Another was later detained, while the main suspect was arrested in Saudi Arabia. \"It's a sad and unfortunate incident,\" Bangladesh's Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal was quoted by bdnews.24 as saying. \"One [man] has been remanded and another has been arrested. The rest will be arrested soon. None will be spared.\" An autopsy report said that Samiul - who helped his family to sell vegetables - died of a brain haemorrhage after sustaining head injuries. More than 60 injury marks were found on his body. A Twitter page in his honour has been set up.\n",

            "Input: summarize: Now, on the surface, these words from Michael Gove shouldn't be surprising. A minister wouldn't advertise disunity. The surprise though is that - as one of the most prominent Leave campaigners - he was talking about an implementation period post-Brexit which could last for an unspecified amount of time. Insiders say his arrival at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and dealing with the powerful farming lobby may have influenced his view. Some of the most prominent Remain ministers have been expressing relief - tinged in one case with just a hint of triumphalism - that they think in recent weeks that they have managed to sell the idea of a soft landing - or as some say \"no cliff edge\" - after the UK leaves the EU in 2019 to some of their more sceptical colleagues. So much for unity. Where do differences still lie? It was interesting that, in answering my question on whether freedom of movement would continue under an implementation period, that Michael Gove didn't rule this out. Migration, he argued, would be decided by the needs of the economy. But for how long? The tectonic plates may have moved on a transitional deal but its duration is where cabinet fault lines persist. Liam Fox has been pretty clear he doesn't want to contemplate anything more than two years. As one minister put it - he has waited forty years to leave the EU so two more won't matter. But anther prominent cabinet Brexiteer told me he thought it would be a \"disaster\" if the implementation period hadn't concluded by the assumed date of the next election in 2022 while others have talked about anything up to a four year period. Then what form will any transition take? Could there be temporary membership of the European Economic Area? Some leavers might be suspicious that temporary would become permanent. Should we stay in the customs union a bit longer until we hammer out a bespoke deal post Brexit? The EU is unlikely to get the clarity it seeks until there is clarity around the cabinet table. So while some Remainer ministers I have spoken to this week were upbeat, relaxed and chipper - and believe that British business is making its influence felt - many issues remain unresolved\n",

In 2013, police investigating the 36-year-old's disappearance said they had begun a murder inquiry. On Monday, two men, aged 45 and 43, were arrested in Carrickfergus. The pair were released on police bail on Monday night pending further enquiries. The body of Mr Gourley, who was described by police as a \"vulnerable individual\" who had been on medication at the time of his disappearance, has never been found. Det Insp Darren McCartney appealed to anyone who may have information about Mark's disappearance or who may have seen Mark on or after 7 March 2009 to contact police. \"Previous appeals for information did generate reports of sightings but the last definite sighting of Mark was at 2.30pm on 7 March 2009 in the Burney's Lane area of Glengormley,\" he said. \"Mark did not have a mobile phone or a significant amount of money with him when he disappeared.\" Police said although Mr Gourley was last seen in the Glengormley area, he was from the Castlemara area of Carrickfergus and he may have returned to that area on 7 March 2009. \"Police are asking for anyone who may have noticed vehicles or individuals acting suspiciously in either the Burney's Lane area of Glengormley or in the Castlemara area of Carrickfergus around 7 March 2009 to contact police on the non-emergency number 101,\" Det Insp McCartney said. \"I believe there are people in these communities who have knowledge of what happened to Mark. \"Additionally, people may have heard rumours about what happened to Mark. I would appeal to them to share this information with police. \"If anyone has information about him, I would ask them to examine their conscience and come forward to police.\" Mr Gourley was about 5ft, 9\" tall, described as well-built, with fair, cropped hair, and an eyebrow bolt in his right eyebrow.

The tech company's DeepMind division said its software had beaten its human rival five games to nil. One independent expert called it a breakthrough for AI with potentially far-reaching consequences. The achievement was announced to coincide with the publication of a paper, in the scientific journal Nature, detailing the techniques used. Earlier on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive had said its own AI project had been \"getting close\" to beating humans at Go. But the research he referred to indicated its software was ranked only as an \"advanced amateur\" and not a \"professional level\" player. Go is thought to date back to ancient China, several thousand years ago. Using black-and-white stones on a grid, players gain the upper hand by surrounding their opponents pieces with their own. The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves compared with about 20 in chess. There are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe, according to DeepMind's team. It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct. DeepMind's chief executive, Demis Hassabis, said its AlphaGo software followed a three-stage process, which began with making it analyse 30 million moves from games played by humans. \"It starts off by looking at professional games,\" he said. \"It learns what patterns generally occur - what sort are good and what sort are bad. If you like, that's the part of the program that learns the intuitive part of Go. \"It now plays different versions of itself millions and millions of times, and each time it gets incrementally better. It learns from its mistakes. \"The final step is known as the Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is really the planning stage. \"Now it has all the intuitive knowledge about which positions are good in Go, it can make long-range plans.\" Tested against rival Go-playing AIs, Google's system won 499 out of 500 matches, And last October, DeepMind invited Fan Hui, Europe's top player, to its London office\n",

The dinosaur's missing foot was found at the beach by palaeontology student, Sam Davies, of Bridgend, at the beginning of this month. \"My first reaction was that I was very lucky,\" he said. The fossilised skeleton of the theropod - a distant cousin of the giant Tyrannosaurus rex - went on display at the National Museum Cardiff's main hall in June after it was found by fossil-hunting brothers Nick and Rob Hanigan. Mr Davies, who studies at the University of Portsmouth, visited Lavernock, near Penarth, after his tutor told him its cliffs were rich with fossils. He arrived only hours after a cliff fall had exposed the fossil and before it could be washed away by the tide. \"It was pure luck that I found it. It was just sitting on top of a slab of rock,\" he said. His tutor, Dr David Martill, confirmed the find was the missing foot of the recently discovered dinosaur, after the student emailed a picture. Dr Martill said: \"This was a chance-in-a-million find and highlights how important it is to encourage fossil hunting in this country.\" He said the specimen would help chart the evolution of dinosaur feet. The foot has been donated to the Amgueddfa Cymru, which hopes to put it on display with the rest of the skeleton soon. Dr Caroline Buttler, head of palaeontology at the museum, said: \"The dinosaur found by Nick and Rob Hanigan is the first skeleton of a theropod found in Wales. \"Sam's find adds to its significance because we can learn more about the animal and how it is related to the dinosaurs that eventually evolved into birds.\"\n",

The housing developments are part of the Together Building United Communities programme. DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly said she had visited about 100 homes and found mixed views among residents. But a DUP spokesman said earlier flags or any other emblems supporting paramilitaries had no place in communities and should all be all removed. \"Paramilitaries are a plague on society,\" the spokesman told the BBC's Nolan Show. \"The DUP condemns all those who cling to criminality and violence.\" The Police Service of Northern Ireland said removing flags was not its responsibility, and police would only act to remove flags where there were \"substantial risks to public safety\". \"We will work with local communities and respond to any issues where there is a concern for public safety or where it is believed a criminal offence has occurred,\" said the PSNI in a statement. Mrs Little Pengelly spent a number of hours going door-to-door to meet local residents on Monday evening, and afterwards spoke to the BBC. \"There were some people who were very supportive of the flags, people who felt very much it was part of the tradition of the local area and the wider area,\" she said. \"The majority of people said to me: 'We understand that the flags have gone up, but we also understand that they will come back down again'. \"Really they didn't want a public fuss around this matter,\" she added. \"And there were some who had concerns around this, who would prefer for the flags not to be there. \"The way I would put this is that it was a much more complex picture than I was imagining. \"There were some concerns raised, I reassured those individuals that I would be here to support them as well, I would represent their views to the housing association.\" The housing developments are near the Ravenhill and Cregagh roads, which border the South Belfast and East Belfast constituencies.

Edward's family claimed disability living allowance (DLA) on his behalf to help towards the added cost of life as a quad-amputee but when he turned 16 he had to reapply for a personal independence payment (PIP).

According to the paper, it's been suggested it would take four biomass boilers running non-stop every day for 20 years to rack up a £2.5m claim. That's a lot of heat. Meanwhile, the News Letter leads on the news that the public inquiry into the scheme will not sit for any public hearings before March's assembly election.

Judging by events just in the last month or so, the panel has its work cut out. Elsewhere, the News Letter dedicates the rest of its front page, and three pages inside, to what it describes as Stormont's condemnation of a \"missing man bail scandal\". The debate at Stormont was inspired by the case of Damien Joseph McLaughlin, a man charged in connection with the murder of prison officer David Black who has gone missing after being bailed.

Up to 5,000 IS fighters were believed to be in Mosul ahead of the assault. Despite the territorial gains, commanders have warned that securing Mosul could take weeks, if not months. About 50,000 Iraqi security forces personnel, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen are involved in the operation. More than 100 US military personnel are embedded with them, advising commanders and helping direct coalition air strikes. Other US troops are providing fire support from nearby bases. Lt Gen Stephen Townsend, the commander of US forces in Iraq, said on Wednesday that the coalition forces had delivered more than 2,100 aerial bombs, artillery and mortar shells, rockets and missiles since 17 October. \"This relentless campaign of strikes has removed hundreds of fighters, weapons, and key leaders from the battlefield in front of the Iraqi advance,\" he added. On Thursday, the head of the US military's Central Command, Gen Joseph Votel, told the AFP news agency: \"Just in the operations over the last week and a half associated with Mosul, we estimate they've probably killed about 800-900 Islamic State fighters.\" The Iraqi government informed US commanders on Wednesday that 57 Iraqi soldiers had been killed and about 250 wounded. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are thought to have suffered about 20 to 30 fatalities.

            "Input: summarize: The think tank said the city's 1,536 schools needed to save £360m in the first year if the government's National Funding Formula (NFF) plan goes ahead. The amount is the equivalent of 12,857 qualified teachers, on an average salary of £28,000. The government said London was the highest funded part of the country. It added that under the plans, which are under consultation, inner-city schools would be allocated 30% more money per pupil than the national average. But London Councils, which represents the city's 32 boroughs and the City, said no school would gain enough funding from the NFF to compensate for increased cost pressures from inflation, higher pension contributions and national insurance. Ministers said the new formula was needed to tackle uneven levels of funding across England, with the best funded areas getting more than £6,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded averaging £4,200. It said the funding cut was on top of National Audit Office figures which showed England schools faced an eight per cent real-terms cut per pupil by 2019-20 because it wider cost pressures. In a statement, London Councils said: \"At a time when UK schools are seen as underperforming by international standards, and when businesses based in London are facing massive uncertainty about recruiting skilled staff, there is an urgent need to invest in schools in London and across the rest of the country.\" It added: \"Without the right qualifications and skills, London's children will be unable to access jobs and contribute to the national economy. Over 60% of jobs in inner London require a degree and around 45% of jobs in the rest of the capital require a degree.\"\n",

Tim Murtagh (2-85) reduced Surrey to 23-2 inside the first six overs, before Rory Burns (88) aided the recovery. Burns and Roy put on a 118-run fourth wicket stand as Surrey closed on 384-8. Roy's century was a fine retort against Division One leaders Middlesex, who dismissed the England limited-overs opener for a first-ball duck in the One-Day Cup on Tuesday. After paceman Murtagh removed both Zafar Ansari and Dominic Sibley early on, Surrey's slump continued as James Franklin trapped Aaron Finch (37) to leave them 70-3.

The government says school funding is at a record £40bn, with rises ahead. Education Secretary Justine Greening will hear heads' cash grievances at Friday's ASCL conference in Birmingham. She is due to address the union, which has published a survey of its members on the issue. It suggests schools are finding it difficult to make savings without cutting provision and that things are predicted to get worse over the next two years. Cost pressures are rising as greater pay, pension and national insurance costs are having to be covered from school budgets. ASCL complains a new funding formula for schools has reduced the basic level of school funding going forwards by too much. The meeting comes two days after requests for more money to spend on daily school costs were ignored by the chancellor in the Budget. Philip Hammond however did pledge £500m for school buildings, mainly new free schools - some of which could be grammar schools. One respondent said his school was moving to a \"bare bones education\", in which \"the components that make education special and enjoyable are being eroded away\". Some 95% of the 1,054 heads, deputies and senior teachers responding to the survey said they had cut back on support services - including equipment and materials, as well as mental health and special needs support. More than eight out of 10 said class sizes had increased - a claim strongly refuted by the Department for Education. And more than two-thirds said they had cut back on activities like clubs and trips. Just under three-quarters of respondents with GCSE-level classes said they had cut courses and just over three-quarters of heads with A-level students said they had also reduced subjects. Foreign modern languages, music, arts and drama were among subjects removed at A-level. Another said: \"Through no fault of their own, students will have restricted subject choices, in larger class sizes with less pastoral support, whilst still being expected to perform at the highest of standards - nonsense!\" One head said his school may have to axe its sixth form provision for next year and another said his school was starting to \"creak\" with all staff working to full capacity.

Directly elected mayors were created by the Local Government Act 2000 as one option for local government, as long as the idea was backed in a referendum. Mr Howlett said he was \"personally concerned\" that an elected mayor was not appropriate for an area \"as diverse\" as Bath and North East Somerset, and that it could \"lead to an increase in the cost of local politics\". \"The level of misinformation on this issue is worrying - many people seem to still believe this is about a mayor of Bath and not understanding it would cover all of Bath and North East Somerset. \"I hope in the coming weeks more information will be forthcoming to enable residents to make an informed decision,\" he added.\n",

A brawl erupted but the attackers fled before police arrived. Police are now investigating, and say they have questioned the attackers and cafe staff. Nobody has been arrested. The cafe has appealed for public support, saying it was no prank but a case of intimidation by neo-Nazis. The attackers wore strings of sausages round their necks and threw chunks of meat onto customers' plates, the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie reports from Tbilisi. They are known as the Bergmann group, and a social media page shows their attacks on people of Arab or African origin, our correspondent reports. One photograph shows members making the Nazi salute. The Kiwi cafe is in a traditional part of old Tbilisi, and is popular among young people sporting unconventional hairstyles, tattoos and body piercings. Most Georgians are Orthodox Christians and many see unorthodox lifestyles as a corrupting influence from the West. The cafe said it had drawn some local hostility because of \"the way we look, music that we listen to, ideas we support, and the fact that we don't eat meat\" and backing of causes such as rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. \"During these hard times you can support us just by visiting our cafe, we will be very grateful if you come to show everyone that here are a lot of us who care about the issue!\" the Kiwi cafe said in a statement on Facebook. It later told the BBC it had received strong messages of solidarity - from Georgia and abroad - but that people had also left angry comments trying \"to defend those fascists\". It said it was also appealing for financial contributions to install security cameras in case of repeat incidents. The incident comes amid growing concerns about the rise of far-right nationalism in Georgia. Last week, hundreds of nationalists marched through central Tbilisi - waving Georgian flags and anti-communist banners, reports said - to mark independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Homophobia is also commonplace in Georgia, correspondents say.\n",

Islamic State militants also operate in the area. Earlier, at least two Afghan policemen were killed by US forces in a so-called friendly fire incident in southern Afghanistan. The deaths are said to have occurred when a US aircraft returned fire during a joint operation in the restive province of Helmand. It is reported to be the first friendly fire incident in Helmand since US Marines returned there in May. Taliban insurgents have made widespread gains in the province. In a statement, the US military apologised for the incident and said that an investigation had been launched. It happened as police were on patrol in volatile Nad Ali district. The dead were members of the Afghan Border Police. Afghan officials told AFP news agency that the policemen were patrolling too close to a Taliban base prior to the attack. They say a number of militants were also killed in the strike. In recent months, the Taliban have captured several districts in Helmand and put provincial capital Lashkar Gah under pressure. The arrival of hundreds of US Marines - following the withdrawal of US troops three years ago - is part of the Nato-led effort to train and assist Afghan forces. They include special forces who conduct separate counter-terrorism operations.

Large numbers are exported to Hong Kong, where they are consumed or further exported to mainland China. \"On the issue of shark's fin, with immediate effect we are happy to agree to ban the carriage,\" Cathay Pacific said in a statement on Wednesday.

The find was made in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland, which is to be connected to the German island of Fehmarn via the tunnel link. \"Finding a hafted [handle-bearing] axe as well preserved as this one is quite amazing,\" said Soren Anker Sorensen, an archaeologist at the Museum Lolland-Falster in Denmark. Archaeologists have found other similarly well preserved organic material in the area during their excavations. These include upright wooden stakes, a paddle, bows and other axe shafts. Axes were vital tools for Stone Age people, who used them for working wood. However, they also played an important role during the introduction of farming to Europe, when the majority of the land was covered by dense forests. The archaeologists suggest that the Neolithic communities of south Lolland may have been using the coast as an offering area. Earlier this month, archaeologists working on the Fehmarn Belt Tunnel scheme announced that they had uncovered 5,000-year-old footprints along the edge of an ancient fish trap excavated at Rodbyhavn.\n",

            "Input: summarize: Trouble is, the aspen tree itself doesn't like to produce seeds which makes life very difficult for everyone. But last year I visited Shropshire company Forestart and helped them out with their plans to get their aspens in a seed producing mood. Forestart harvests a billion wild tree seeds every year to grow into new trees for planting. You can read a blogpost about their plans here, but here's the general gist. Aspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree. That's no good for Forestart who need seeds to grow new aspens. The last time aspens in Scotland flowered and produced seeds was twenty years ago. So Robert Lee from Forestart had a plan. I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees. Not all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk. The idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds. Well this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature. Robert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see. It's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year. Can we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference? Well yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree. Those branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden. It's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers. The trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future. Meaning more chances for people\n",

The health department replaced it in 2015, but says it needs to \"balance the books\". Diving instructor Steve Bougourd said he was \"gobsmacked\". \"I'm just worried that this kind of cost will put people off of actually going to the [hospital] and notifying them if they suspect a problem,\" he said. \"We may find it's going to be very expensive to get out divers insured.\" In the UK hyperbaric oxygen treatment is covered by the NHS, but Guernsey has its own health care system. Source: NHS Assistant director at Guernsey's health and social care department (HSC) Ed Freestone said renting the chamber was costing the government £60,000 a year. He said the department would not make a profit from the new charges, which were based on \"the average usage that we could identify over the previous few years\". In addition to paying for the training of staff and the maintenance of a 24 hour service, the department had to fund plans to buy its own chamber for about £250,000, Mr Freestone said. Commercial divers already pay a £150 notification fee to dive which raises about £10,000 a year, according to HSC.

A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says. Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled. IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS \"caliphate\", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria. \"According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,\" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory. He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey. He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer. The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes. The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings. Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms. In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children. Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town. Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added. Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militant\n",

The rate was an upward revision from the previous estimate of 1.2%, which itself was an increase from the original reading of 0.7%. However, it still marks a slowdown from the final quarter of 2016, when the economy grew at a rate of 2.1%. The latest growth figure was helped by an increased estimate for growth in consumer spending, which was revised up to a rate of 1.1% from 0.6%. \"The economy is expanding at a solid, if unspectacular pace,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services. Growth estimates in the first quarter are often weak, a quirk some say is due to the difficulty of measuring the effect of seasonal changes. Thursday's update bolsters the perspective of the Federal Reserve, which increased interest rates in June. Policymakers at the time said they did not believe the slowdown in the first quarter was the start of a trend, pointing to one-off factors, including a relatively mild winter. Stronger-than-expected trade figures published Wednesday also led some to predict better growth in the second quarter. Even so, many say growth for the year is all but certain to fall short of the 3% goal outlined by US President Donald Trump. Mr Faucher forecasts growth around 2.2% for the year. The International Monetary Fund this week cut its forecast for US economic growth, in part citing uncertainty over the chances for tax reform and infrastructure spending, policies that many say could provide an economic boost.\n",

The figures were obtained by the Press Association news agency (PA) under the Freedom of Information Act. PA sent Freedom of Information requests to every police force in England and Wales asking how many times illegal drugs had been seized or confiscated from school premises in the period from March 2011 to the end of 2014. The query asked for details of the type and amount of drug involved, its value, the type of school (primary or secondary) and details of who it was seized or confiscated from. Just over three-quarters of forces replied. Of these, 28 forces gave details of the types of drugs involved, 18 forces identified the type of school and 13 the ages of the individuals involved. The data reveals cannabis was involved in 625 of the cases and cocaine in 27. Other drugs confiscated included LSD, amphetamines and ecstasy. Overall there were two cases each of heroin possession at schools in the West Midlands, Surrey and Greater Manchester, plus another in Hertfordshire. Only four incidents involved children under 11. An eight-year-old and a nine-year-old in Staffordshire were caught with cannabis, as was a 10-year-old girl at a Leicester primary school, while another 10-year-old in Greater Manchester was carrying £5 worth of the drug.

The two-year orders aim to disrupt gang-related violence between the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew. West Midlands Police said it was \"a landmark ruling\". The orders follow a spate of firearms offences in the city in 2015 and 2016, but the gangs have struck fear across parts of Birmingham for many years. They gained notoriety in 2003 when their violent feud claimed the lives of two girls - Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis - outside a late-night new year party in the city. Four men were later jailed for life for their murders. The gangs have also been behind countless drive-by shootings, drug dealing, intimidation, robberies and kidnappings. After more recent incidents of gun crime in the city, West Midlands Police and the council sought to secure the injunctions in a civil case heard at Birmingham Crown Court earlier this year. The force secured interim injunctions in 2016 and said at the time it did not want to identify anyone until they were permanent. The BBC revealed their names after obtaining the county court documents. More than 80 people from the Home Office and police gave evidence between February and June ahead of the orders being granted in July, which the force has revealed for the first time now.

In the draft proposal, the height of the embankment and the walls were simply too high and the public did not support that. \"What we now need to do is make sure that we find a solution that deals with the flooding, regenerates the Whitesands, solves the car parking issues, but also reduces the height of any proposed flood protection scheme.\" Water from the River Nith regularly spills over into the Whitesands, flooding a major town centre car park and nearby business premises. Campaigners against the £15m proposal to build an embankment claimed it would have a detrimental effect on the town's main beauty spots. They also raised concerns that the move would lead to the loss of about 200 waterfront car parking spaces. David Slater, a local businessman who has been one of the project's most vocal objectors, said: \"However many other consultations they do now, public opinion will not change at this stage. \"It will be interesting to see how they can agree with the public to reduce the height of the bunds. There has to be better ideas because we can't put that in our town.\" Earlier this year MSPs called for the row over the flood protection plans to be brought to a \"positive conclusion\".\n",

            "Input: summarize: The towns of Virginia Water and Cobham, in Surrey, have become Britain's first million pound towns - where average house prices are more than £1m. Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire is also in the millionaire's club, according to research by Lloyds Bank. They are the first towns outside London where prices have hit seven figures. The research was based on data from the Land Registry for the first half of 2015. Prices in Virginia Water - home to the likes of Sir Cliff Richard and Sir Bruce Forsyth - average no less than £1.169m, making it Britain's most expensive town outside the capital. No wonder that the town's famous golf course, Wentworth, feels able to charge joining fees of £125,000. That is on top of the annual membership fee of £16,000. Cobham - familiar to Chelsea footballers and their WAGS - has average prices of £1.043m. And anyone wanting to buy in Beaconsfield can expect to pay £1.003m. \"We're seeing the emergence of towns where the average price is at least £1 million,\" said Sarah Deaves, private banking director at Lloyds Bank. \"Whilst there are several London neighbourhoods where prices are already at this elevated level, outside of the capital this is a first.\" However the figures also show a sharp slow-down in the number of homes sold for more than £1m. In the first half of 2015 there were 5,599 such sales, down from 6,303 in 2014. That amounts to an 11% fall. One reason for that is the change in Stamp Duty rates, introduced in December 2014. The buyer of a £1m house will now pay £43,750 in Stamp Duty, up from £40,000 previously.\n",

            "Input: summarize: They describe it as a kind of \"jet stream\" - a fast-flowing river of liquid iron that is surging westwards under Alaska and Siberia. The moving mass of metal has been inferred from measurements made by Europe’s Swarm satellites. This trio of spacecraft are currently mapping Earth's magnetic field to try to understand its fundamental workings. The scientists say the jet is the best explanation for the patches of concentrated field strength that the satellites observe in the northern hemisphere. \"This jet of liquid iron is moving at about fifty kilometres per year,\" explained Dr Chris Finlay from the National Space Institute at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Space). “That might not sound like a lot to you on Earth's surface, but you have to remember this a very dense liquid metal and it takes a huge amount of energy to move this thing around and that's probably the fastest motion we have anywhere within the solid Earth,” he told BBC News. Dr Finlay was speaking here at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in San Francisco, just ahead of the official publication of the research in the journal Nature Geoscience. Most people will be familiar with the atmospheric jet stream - the high-altitude, rapidly flowing belt of air on which aeroplanes ride to get to their destination more quickly. Dr Finlay and colleagues want us to envision something similar but made of metal and 3,000km down, under our feet. They assess the jet to be about 420km wide, and say it wraps half-way around the planet. Its behaviour will be critical to the generation and maintenance of the global magnetic field, they add. “It's likely that the jet stream has been in play for hundreds of millions of years,\" said Dr Phil Livermore from Leeds University, UK, and the lead author on the journal paper. In the paper, the team puts forward a model to explain the jet. The scientists say the feature probably aligns to a boundary between two different regions in the core. They call this boundary the \"tangent cylinder\". They imagine this as a tube sitting around the solid inner core, running along Earth’s rotation axis. When liquid iron approaches the boundary from both sides, it gets squeezed out sideways to form the jet, which then hugs the imaginary tube. \"Of course, you need\n",

The Scottish government, the NHS, Amnesty International and various other organisations including trade unions and local authorities were involved in creating the action plan. Areas of concern when drawing up the document included: care, disability rights, health, criminal justice and business. Commitments have been made by the bodies behind the plan to integrate human rights more closely into their work. Commission chair Professor Alan Miller said: \"Today, International Human Rights Day, Scotland is taking a big step towards building a country where everyone can live a life of human dignity. \"The Scottish Parliament has human rights at its heart, it created the Scottish Human Rights Commission and today Scotland's first National Action Plan for Human Rights is launched as the next step on Scotland's journey to progressively realise internationally agreed human rights for the benefit of everyone.\" Although this is the first human rights action plan in the UK, they do exist in other countries, such as Sweden, Spain, New Zealand and Australia.

But there are some significant ways Mr Trump is already altering his campaign strategy - sometimes in direct conflict with promises and assertions he made during his long, successful race to the top of the Republican Party. Here are five. Mr Trump has repeatedly boasted that he was paying for his campaign out of his own personal fortune. \"By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists,\" he posted on Facebook back in September. \"I am only working for the people of the US!\" Even though that's not exactly true - Mr Trump was loaning his campaign money and could someday pay it back, in addition to raising funds through donations - it was a central part of his pitch to those put off by the current political system. Now, however, all pretence is gone. Mr Trump announced he's hired a veteran money man - a former Goldman Sachs partner, no less - as his national finance chairman. And on Tuesday he reached an agreement with the Republican Party to conduct joint fundraising through a network of committees that can take donations of up to $449,400 (£307,850) per person. Mr Trump's move is an acknowledgement that he would be hard-pressed to self-finance a general election campaign, which could cost more than $1bn. He's wealthy - but he's not that wealthy. Mr Trump has repeatedly insisted campaign-funded opinion polls are a waste of money. \"I don't have pollsters,\" he said last August. \"I don't want to be unreal. I want to be me. I have to be me. You know, we have enough of that in Washington, with pollsters telling everybody what to say and everybody being controlled by the special interests, and the lobbyists, et cetera, and the donors.\" In fact, Mr Trump was dismissive of the whole idea of data-driven campaigns - including President Barack Obama's winning presidential bids. \"Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine, and I think the same is true with me\n",

Though these are early days, no Premier League match so far this season has seen less action. Two months ago, football's lawmakers revealed they were considering scrapping 45-minute halves, instead introducing two periods of 30 minutes, during which the clock would be stopped every time the ball went out. The proposal, the International Football Association Board said, was one of a number of options to deter football's \"negativities\". So would the rule have benefited supporters at Premier League matches so far this season? In a word, yes. Of 19 top-flight games across the opening two weekends of the campaign, the ball has been in play for more than an hour in only two of them. And no game has featured more than 61 minutes of play. Food for thought for fans and lawmakers alike. Here's the rest of the key Premier League statistics from the weekend. It was a landmark weekend for Wayne Rooney as he joined Alan Shearer in the 200 Premier League goals club with his strike against Manchester City on Monday. Here's how and when he has scored them. Rooney has some way to go to beat former Newcastle and Blackburn striker Shearer's record of 260 goals, although his goal at Etihad Stadium was his fifth in his past eight Premier League games. If he can keep that up then who knows...... try, try again? Well doing just that doesn't appear to be yielding results in the Premier League so far this season. Harry Kane must have some sort of pox on him that prevents him from scoring in August, and it's hard not to sympathise as everything conspired to deny him a goal against Chelsea on Sunday.

Scotland were undone by misfortune and brilliance; two momentary interventions that extinguished their hopes. The performance overall was not bereft, which was in keeping with the tournament as a whole since Brown's team drew 0-0 with the Netherlands in the opening match and went on to defeat Switzerland 1-0. Even so, the game still stands out in the long history of encounters between the Auld Enemy, for its circumstances, its drama and, to an extent, its heartache. England needed to recover from a disappointing 1-1 draw with Switzerland in their opening game that exacerbated the criticism of the players. Manager Terry Venables had taken the squad to Hong Kong prior to the tournament, where some were pictured out drinking heavily. Damage caused to the plane on the journey home brought further condemnation, while also building a siege mentality amongst the players and Venables, who had already announced he would be standing down after Euro 96 and would be succeeded by Glenn Hoddle. Scotland were buoyed by holding the Dutch to a draw and although underdogs at Wembley, there was no sense of inferiority. Of the team that started the match, Colin Calderwood was at Tottenham, Colin Hendry had won the Premier League the year before with Blackburn (alongside England striker Alan Shearer), Gary McAllister was at Leeds and John Spencer was at Chelsea. The rest of the team was made up of players from Aberdeen, Celtic and Rangers. For Scotland, naturally, the tie stirred memories of past excursions to Wembley and the fans mobilised en masse to London with a sense of living up to the zealous spirit of their predecessors. The occasion worked with and against Scotland, though, since the England players were fired up by the historical significance of the game as much as the need to establish their worth at Euro 96. Before kick-off, England full-back Stuart Pearce could barely look at the Scots as they shook hands. \"You've got no friends when you play against a team like that,\" he later recalled.

Dundee Sheriff Court heard how the pair had met through mutual friends in 2015 but there was no contact between them until June 2016 when he added her on the social networking app. Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said that when they met they chatted for some time and the accused was immediately affectionate towards the girl, kissing and cuddling her. \"He told her he had been 'choking to go with her' and they then walked towards the college,\" Ms Robertson said. \"He repeatedly asked her if she would have sex with him, and when in the grounds of the college he said 'have sex with me there' and pointed to a grassy area. \"They went there and had sex, after which he stood up and said he had to leave.\" The girl's mother picked her up before the 13-year-old told her what had happened the next day.

            "Input: summarize: One of them, the blogger Prof Michael Pettis of the Beijing Business School, had earned kudos as one of the first to predict the sharp slowdown in China's economy seen over the last year. The other was the Economist. The magazine, that is. Their bet - for a bottle of booze - was over whether China's economy was about to run out of puff. The country has managed 9.9% growth on average over the past 35 years, but Prof Pettis thinks that the growth rate will fall to a measly (by Chinese standards) 3% this decade. The more gung-ho Economist by contrast was forecasting that China would stay on course to overtake the US as the world's biggest economy by 2018. \"China has grown very rapidly in the last 30 years, but it has been following a model that is not unique,\" says Prof Pettis. \"In the 50s and 60s almost everyone 'knew' that the Soviet Union would overtake the US in the 70s - even Jack Kennedy - but it didn't happen. Instead, the Russian economy got mired in debt and years of stagnation.\" Other examples include the Brazilian economic \"miracle\" of the 1960s and 1970s, says Prof Pettis, that ended in a 1982 financial crisis and a \"lost decade\" of growth, or Japan's rapid ascent up until its own 1990 crisis and subsequent two-decade stagnation. What these countries have in common is an enormous level of government-led investment - in roads, trains, schools, hospitals, education and training. \"You can get tremendous growth by keeping investment levels high,\" he explains. \"And in the early days, growth is healthy and sustainable. \"But later... you very easily reach a point where you can't identify economically viable projects any more, and you overshoot and start misallocating capital in a pretty significant way. That's when debt rises more quickly than the economy's capacity to service it.\" China has been overinvesting perhaps since the 1990s, according to Prof Pettis, and certainly in the last five to 10 years. \"A lot of growth is fake,\" he says. \"If you spend $1bn building an airport, it generates the same amount of [economic output]\n",

The panel says the firms failed to allay fears about their association with China's government and military. Huawei and ZTE denied the accusations in front of the panel in September. On Monday ZTE issued a statement insisting its equipment met all US standards and posed no threat. \"ZTE has set an unprecedented standard for co-operation by any Chinese company with a congressional investigation,\" China's Xinhua news agency quoted the firm as saying. How China became the US election bogeyman Huawei's vice-president, William Plummer, said the latest accusations were \"dangerous political distractions\". \"Purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignores technical and commercial realities, recklessly threatens American jobs and innovation, does nothing to protect national security.\" While the House Intelligence report stopped short of calling for a boycott of the firms' mobile phone products, it was highly critical of the two companies. \"China has the means, opportunity and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,\" the report says. \"Based on available classified and unclassified information, Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems.\" The panel said their investigation had received credible allegations from current and former Huawei employees of bribery and corruption, discriminatory behaviour and copyright infringement. Republican committee chairman Mike Rogers said they had passed on information to the FBI to investigate the allegations. \"We've come to the conclusion, unfortunately, they are not private entities,\" Mr Rogers said on Monday. On Sunday, Mr Rogers delivered a blunt verdict to the 60 Minutes programme on US network CBS. \"If I were an American company today... and you are looking at Huawei, I would find another vendor if you care about your intellectual property, if you care about your consumers' privacy, and you care about the national security of the United States of America,\" he said. Among the report's recommendations were to exclude any Huawei or ZTE equipment or component parts from being used by government contractors, as well both companies becoming \"more transparent and responsive to US legal obligations\".

Shadow minister Kate Green said it was \"offensive, hurtful... and divisive\". Mr Cameron said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had told the migrants at the camp \"they could all come to Britain\". At the weekend, the Labour leader visited the Grande-Synthe Camp, near Dunkirk, and The Jungle in Calais, where more than 7,000 people are sleeping rough, describing conditions there as \"disgraceful\". Jeremy Corbyn had a good go at David Cameron over the Google tax deal, using a crowd-sourced question from Jeff (or possibly Geoff), who wanted to know whether he could join a scheme allowing him to pay the same rate of tax as the internet giant. But some commentators felt the Labour leader lost focus when he switched to other subjects for his final two questions. \"We've had no answer on Google, and no answers on Jeff,\" said Mr Corbyn, before turning to what he calls the \"bedroom tax\" and a High Court ruling that it is \"discriminatory\". For his final question, he called on the PM to launch an inquiry into arms export licences to Saudi Arabia amid UN reports of coalition air strikes on civilians in Yemen. The prime minister responded to that last point by saying the UK had some of the strictest rules for arms exports in the world. He added that Britain was \"not part of Saudi-led operations\" in Yemen. But it was one of those weeks when reaction to what was said at PMQs overshadowed anything that was said during the session, as Labour seized on Mr Cameron's \"bunch of migrants\" comment. Mr Cameron was coming to the end of a clash with Jeremy Corbyn about Google's tax deal with the government, when he decided, as he often does, to broaden out his attack to other issues. The Labour leader had just accused him of failing to stand up to Google. Mr Cameron replied: \"The shadow chancellor's pointing - the idea that those two right honourable gentlemen would stand up to anyone in this regard is laughable. \"Look at the record over the last week - they met\n",

Mercedes were found to have gone beyond the degree permitted to help a driver solve a technical problem. They broke a rule saying: \"The driver must drive the car alone and unaided.\" Mercedes have lodged an intention to appeal against the decision. The Formula 1 rules were changed this year to introduce restrictions on how much teams can help drivers while they are out on track. Teams are allowed to intervene if the car has a \"critical problem if a failure of a component or system is imminent and potentially terminal\". Race stewards found Mercedes were allowed to give Rosberg instructions on the settings he needed to resolve the problem. But they should not have responded to his subsequent question on whether he should then change gear so the car went straight through seventh gear. Rosberg's engineer Tony Ross replied to the German's information that he had a gearbox problem with the words: \"Driver default 1-0-1, chassis default 0-1, chassis default 0-1. Avoid seventh gear, Nico, avoid seventh gear.\" Rosberg then asked: \"What does that mean, I have to shift through it? Engineer: \"Affirm Nico, you need to shift through it. Affirm, you need to shift through it.\" Both Mercedes F1 team boss Toto Wolff and his opposite number at Red Bull, Christian Horner, questioned the need for the rules restricting driver assistance. Horner said: \"The rule is rubbish. It doesn't make a great deal of sense. But the rules are the rules. \"The cars are technically very complex and you can understand why Mercedes would want to give that message to keep their driver running. \"It's a team sport and the cars are a lot more complicated than they were even four years ago for the drivers to work out what they should and shouldn't be doing. \"The question going forward is are these rules right for F1?

            "Input: summarize: Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool would have drawn level on points with leaders Manchester City with a fifth successive Premier League victory, but were subdued by a classic Jose Mourinho performance of defensive organisation and discipline. United did not allow Liverpool to build the momentum and intensity that has characterised their game this season, while Mourinho's limited attacking ambitions ensured chances were at a premium. The Portuguese was still grateful for two fine second-half saves from goalkeeper David de Gea, who dived low to stop Emre Can and saved athletically from Philippe Coutinho's 25-yard effort. United's best chance also came in the second half, but the unmarked Zlatan Ibrahimovic directed Paul Pogba's cross off target. The visitors had just 35% of possession - their lowest in a Premier League match since Opta began recording the data in 2003-04. Media playback is not supported on this device While this deadlock does little for the ambitions of both teams, there is no doubt who will be the happier manager. This was, in so many respects, the most Mourinho performance of his short time at United. Klopp came on to the pitch at the final whistle to applaud Liverpool's fans, but there was a tinge of disappointment in his measured tread as he trudged off. His side's promising start to the season has been built on pressing opponents into submission - a high-pressure style that has brought victories at Arsenal and Chelsea, as well as nine goals in two home wins against Leicester City and Hull City. But Mourinho picked a powerful, athletic side and instructed them to turn the tables on Liverpool's pressing game. Ander Herrera was at the heart of United's smothering gameplan, almost operating in the pockets of Coutinho and Roberto Firmino in midfield, while Liverpool were never given a second. They simply could not find a way through. United held their shape and discipline, much to their manager's satisfaction, although he still needed those two superb saves from De Gea, and a magnificent saving tackle from Antonio Valencia to stop Firmino as he raced in on goal. It was classic Mourinho, a tactic he has perfected and utilised throughout his career, and An\n",

New standards were introduced by the Welsh government over a year ago aimed at ensuring equal access to healthcare. But the report says little progress has been made. Richard Williams, director of Action on Hearing Loss Cymru said the charities that authored the report are \"really concerned\" that people are leaving surgeries and hospitals unclear about what doctors have told them, what medication they need or whether operations have been successful. New standards were brought in after a BBC Wales investigation in 2013 found health boards were breaching equality laws by not providing accessible services for the deaf and hard of hearing. But 91 per cent of people surveyed for the report said they were not aware of improvements in the way healthcare providers communicate and share information with them. Kay Coleman from Swansea began losing her hearing 15 years ago and said she finds it \"incredibly difficult\" to book a doctor's appointment. An estimated 500,000 people are affected by hearing loss and 100,000 are living with sight loss in Wales. In a statement the Welsh government said it is \"committed to ensuring the standards are fully implemented\" and it is working with relevant bodies \"to establish how best to capture and record communication preferences for those with sensory loss to ensure their needs are fully met in every healthcare setting\".\n",

Paramedics and medical staff from both clubs treated the man until an ambulance arrived at Rugby Park stadium and he was taken to a nearby hospital. Both managers agreed to abandon the match out of respect for the fan. The stadium was hushed into silence when medical staff and club doctors attended the stricken fan in the west stand. The referee then stopped the match with the teams drawing 1-1. Players left the pitch as the gravity of the situation became evident. Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnston said: \"The length of time the players were off the park was a problem but the overriding factor was respect for the fan and his family. \"He collapsed and was tended to by medical staff of both clubs and was taken to Crosshouse Hospital by ambulance.\" He added that he could not reveal any more information about the fan's identity other than to say he was a long-standing season-ticket holder Later, a Police Scotland spokesman said the man died in hospital.

There have been warnings over the cost of the lock, and the government says it will review it after 2020. Shadow Treasury minister Rebecca Long-Bailey said this caused \"uncertainty and worry\", pledging to protect it \"throughout the lifetime of the next Parliament\", due to end in 2025. Speaking during Treasury questions in the Commons, Chancellor Philip Hammond said it was responsible for the government to decide which commitments it can afford to keep at a spending review before the end of Parliament. Attacking Labour's pledge, he added: \"I think it tells us everything we need to know about the Opposition - that three-and-a-half years out they're willing to spray around commitments without any idea of what it's going to cost them.\" During last week's Autumn Statement Mr Hammond said the triple lock would be maintained until 2020 but suggested it would then be reviewed. There have been calls for it to be scrapped, including from former pensions minister Baroness Altmann, who said the costs would become \"enormous\" after 2020, and the previous work and pensions secretary, Stephen Crabb. Speaking after Treasury Questions, shadow chancellor John McDonnell accused the Conservatives of \"abandoning older people\" by not guaranteeing to continue the pledge.

            "Input: summarize: The proposals are the brain child of Swiss businessman turned politician Thomas Minder, who runs a small family company producing natural cosmetics. Mr Minder wants shareholders to have a veto over managers' salaries, and to ban golden handshakes altogether. The \"fat cat initiative\", as it has come to be called, would, if approved, be written into the Swiss constitution, and would apply to all Swiss companies listed on Switzerland's stock exchange. Mr Minder, an outspoken man, says the culture of high salaries and high bonuses in Switzerland has got out of hand, pointing to the fact that huge sums have been paid out even when the companies concerned were doing badly. The bankruptcy of national icon Swissair back in 2001, and the subsequent huge payoffs to its failed boss Mario Corti, were the catalyst to Mr Minder's decision to act. \"That really stuck in my throat,\" he told Swiss television. \"It made me absolutely furious. \"I'm still furious today, to think that a chief executive like Mr Corti could get five years' salary to go. I mean, the company was in a disastrous situation. At the end he wasn't even paying its bills. Swissair went bankrupt. The company doesn't exist anymore.\" Salaries for Swiss top managers are higher than most and their taxes are lower. These two things alone would not necessarily anger most voters, however. What has attracted support for Mr Minder's initiative has been a series of perceived disasters for major Swiss companies, coupled with salaries and bonuses staying high. The main example is banking giant UBS, which wrote off billions in the wake of the 2007 sub-prime mortgage crisis, and then had to be bailed out by the Swiss government. After that, the bank lost more billions because of a rogue trader, and announced thousands of redundancies. But high salaries and bonuses for the bank's top managers continued throughout. \"The fat cats are getting fattest in the banks,\" says Edouard Dommen of the Swiss shareholders group Actares. \"The other companies are getting fat, but not quite so grossly.\" Mr Dommen, who supports the new measures, believes voters are especially angry about UBS, because their own tax money had to be spent to bail out the bank. \"People are fed up,\" he says.\n",

It said that according to Islam transgender people with \"visible signs\" of being male or female may marry someone of the opposite sex. But those with \"visible signs of both genders\" may not marry, it said. The 50 clerics, part of the little-known Tanzeem Ittehad-i-Ummat body based in Lahore, also said any act intended to \"humiliate, insult or tease\" transgender individuals should be considered a crime under Islam. The fatwa is not legally binding in any way. \"We are glad that somebody's talked about us too,\" transgender rights worker Almas Bobby told BBC Urdu. \"By Sharia we already had the right [to marry], but unless measures are taken to remove the misconceptions about us in society, the condition of our community will not be changed.\" Another social worker for gender issues told BBC Urdu that it was a \"good step\", but that issues would remain until transgender marriage was officially legitimised. Qamar Nasim said that many police officers had charged people in transgender marriages because \"due to a lack of knowledge... they consider it same-sex marriage\". \"This practice can only be stopped when [the] government spread awareness about rights of a transgender person.\" Transgender people are discriminated against in Pakistan and struggle to find employment. More than 45 transgender people have been killed in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the past two years, according to local rights group Trans Action. Last month, a 23-year-old transgender activist died after delays in treatment. Alisha, who was shot eight times, was in critical condition when admitted to hospital but staff could not decide whether to put her in a male or female ward, according to her friends.

He told his lawyer that he had been strung up by his handcuffed wrists, had his head shoved down a toilet and been threatened with rape and death. Russia's prison service says the claims are untrue but will investigate if the activist complains formally. Unusually, the allegations made the headlines on state-controlled television on Tuesday after Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the case merited \"the closest attention\" and that President Vladimir Putin would be informed. Dadin's supporters gathered outside the justice ministry on Tuesday evening in protest. Ildar Dadin, 34, says his problems began after he was transferred to Prison Number Seven in the Karelia region of north-western Russia in mid-September and sent directly to a punishment cell. More on this story: Now out of isolation, Dadin has dictated a letter to his wife via his lawyer, in which he says he was beaten and kicked repeatedly by up to a dozen prison staff. One day, he alleges, he was hung from his wrists for about half an hour causing \"extreme pain\". \"They then took off my pants and said that they would bring in another prisoner who would rape me if I didn't agree to end my hunger strike,\" Ildar Dadin writes. He had stopped eating in protest at being held in a punishment cell. Russia's FSIN prison service told the BBC that Mr Dadin was put in isolation for what a spokeswoman called \"violations of the detention regime\", but insisted that his claims of beating and torture were false. \"There's no way illegal methods were used, especially for such a well-known character,\" Kristina Belousova told the BBC by telephone. \"It's not the first time we've seen this, by people trying to attract maximum attention,\" the spokeswoman added.

Researcher Daniel Schavelzon told Argentina's Clarin newspaper that the architecture of the three buildings differed markedly from that of others in the region and that their purpose in the middle of a remote nature reserve was a mystery. He said that a number of objects had been found that linked the buildings to wartime Germany, such as coins minted in the late 1930s and early 1940s and a fragment of Meissen porcelain made in Germany. However, none of the objects has so far been found to have any direct links to any Nazi officers. Mr Schavelzon told Clarin that his team thought previous theories, such as that the building had been built by Jesuit priests, were \"too simplistic\". He also dismissed the local legend that Hitler's private secretary Martin Bormann had lived there. Mr Schavelzon pointed to DNA tests carried out in 1998 on a skeleton found in Berlin that proved Bormann committed suicide in 1945 and did not flee to South America as had long been rumoured. The researcher insisted, though, that the buildings in Teyu Cuare park were very unusual. He said the walls, some of which were 3m (9ft) thick, were \"on an incredible scale\". He also said that their location was \"completely inaccessible\". \"You'd never be able to find them if you didn't know their exact location,\" he said. He said the theory the team was currently working on was that the buildings were constructed as a hide-out by the Nazis in case they lost World War Two. But he said he did not think it was ever used\n",

Austrians like order, or \"Ordnung\" as they say in German. It is hugely frowned upon for a pedestrian to cross the road on a red light. And the streets and underground network of Vienna are kept remarkably clean. But smoky air in cafes and restaurants has been widely tolerated for years. \"Smoking is a sort of culture, especially in Austria,\" Margit Schwed told me as she sat in Cafe Ritter in Vienna, with its gilt chandeliers and marble table tops. \"In the typical Vienna Kaffeehaus you take your coffee and your cigarette. I think people like the flair in the coffee houses.\" Austria has one of the highest rates of smoking in Europe, particularly among young people: 33% of Austrians smoke regularly, according to a 2012 Eurobarometer study. Only Greeks, Bulgarians and Latvians smoke more. A survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that 27% of Austrian 15-year-olds smoke at least once a week, more frequently than any other children in the OECD area. Several years ago, when many countries had already banned smoking in bars and cafes, Austria first adopted the idea of introducing separate smoking and non-smoking areas. Small restaurants could choose whether to go smoke-free or not. Larger restaurants, like Cafe Ritter, were obliged to provide a separate smoking section, sealed off by glass partitions. The law was heavily criticised by doctors and anti-smoking groups as half-hearted and badly enforced. Earlier this year, after the death of a prominent anti-smoking journalist from lung cancer, Austria's coalition government of the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party announced plans to bring in a total ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars by 2018. \"We have finally arrived in Europe with anti-smoking protection,\" Health Minister Sabine Oberhauser said.

These are the types of questions being asked by clubs as they consider investing eye-watering sums on new players. An emerging field of analysts and experts believe they have the answers. But how do they find them? Ever sent a tweet you've come to regret? Last season, Burnley striker Andre Gray apologised and asked \"for forgiveness\" after homophobic tweets he sent in 2012 were shared. And, just last week, Chelsea forward Kenedy was sent home from their pre-season tour of China after being accused of xenophobia and racism. He apologised for the Instagram posts. But what can a club learn from a player's social media presence? Ben Wright is head of sport at communications agency Cicero, which produces reports on players for clients across the globe, including seven in the Premier League and two in Spain's La Liga. He says: \"We look all the way through a player's online presence. By doing this you can get an idea of what kind of person they are and how their character has evolved over time. \"We analyse media coverage, social media, fans' forums, everything that is available online, across 13 languages, to build up a public picture of their life. \"Are they using social media late at night? Do they blur the boundaries of public and private? How have they changed over time as they have begun to earn more money? \"Are they posting the kind of insight into their private lives that fans really appreciate, or is it all about new cars and new clothes? And are they posting this kind of stuff regardless of whether it's been a good or bad result the weekend before?\" Some clubs have developed in-house teams - sometimes within their scouting departments - to perform similar research. But in January, Cicero produced a report on a promising young Premier League player, who will remain anonymous. The analysis uncovered a series of social media posts, dating back several years, that were sexually explicit in nature, and found angry responses to opposition fans that included offensive language. Ultimately, the client who commissioned the report decided not to offer the player what would have been a significant development in his career. Case study: Andrea Belotti Tor\n",

Hearts went ahead when Alexandros Tziolis' shot took a deflection off Keith Lasley and looped over goalkeeper Craig Samson. And Esmael Goncalves struck twice late on, the striker scoring his first goals for the Tynecastle club. Goncalves had an early low shot just wide before Louis Moult's header hit the bar, but the flag was up - wrongly - for offside against the Motherwell striker. The hosts had started the match with a back three in an attempt to stymie the Hearts attack, but as the half wore on the away side became more dangerous. First, a great run from left-back Lennard Sowah forced a save from Samson. Media playback is not supported on this device Then Jamie Walker threatened with a couple of fierce efforts which were just off target. He perhaps should have had a penalty when it looked like he had his shirt pulled in the box. Malaury Martin then stung the palms of Samson with a free-kick from 25 yards, but Motherwell would finish the half strongly. From a corner Lionel Ainsworth fired in a shot which was cleared off the line by Anastasios Avlonitis. McHugh then fired an effort over the bar. Moult was wrongly awarded awarded a free-kick at the edge of the box, having actually been tripped by team-mate Ainsworth. Referee Andrew Dallas even mistakenly booked Hearts midfielder Martin. Moult took the free-kick himself and the ball flew narrowly wide of Jack Hamilton's goal. Red cards defined Motherwell's match with Rangers last weekend and another sending off played a massive part in this match. This time it was McHugh who lunged in, catching Cowie painfully. There were echoes of Scott McDonald's red card tackle on Rangers' Kenny Miller, and it looked like the right decision by Dallas. Just minutes later Hearts opened the scoring.

Media playback is not supported on this device Fifa's 209 nations will gather in Zurich for what is billed as an \"extraordinary congress\". It was called after Sepp Blatter dramatically announced last June that he would step aside after 18 years as Fifa president. The 79-year-old Swiss said he was \"laying down his mandate\", which has led to some concern he may not have actually resigned. However, Fifa officials are confident he will not make an awkward re-appearance - not least because he has been banned from football for eight years over a \"disloyal payment\" of £1.3m to suspended Uefa president Michel Platini. Both men deny wrongdoing and are appealing against their bans. Blatter also has no accreditation to get into the conference hall on the outskirts of Zurich where the congress is being held. There are two big issues to settle. First, the FA representatives have to agree to a package of reforms designed to eliminate the problems that have plunged Fifa into crisis in recent months and restore its reputation. Then, if and when that is formalised, they have to appoint a new president. Media playback is not supported on this device Given the hype and spin around the election the reforms have been slightly forgotten about - but they are vitally important to the organisation's future.

The Royal College of Nursing blamed the 23% drop in nursing applications on the removal of bursaries. Universities Minister Jo Johnson said that despite the overall drop, more 18-year-olds were applying to university. These Ucas admissions figures, up to the January deadline for courses starting in the autumn, show a 5% drop in UK students and 7% drop in students from the European Union - with a total of about 564,000. Universities have been warning about the impact of Brexit on their finances if European applications fall and these figures show a significant decline in candidates from the EU. There has also been a decline in UK students applying - and like the two previous occasions when applications have fallen - this has been when fees are being increased. The fall in applications in England of 6% has been three times greater than in Scotland at 2%, which remains without tuition fees. Applications from Wales fell most, by 7%, and Northern Ireland by 5%. Nursing had the biggest fall of any individual subject, and Janet Davies, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, blamed this on the switch from grants to fees and loans. \"We warned the government the removal of student funding would see a sharp drop in nursing applications. These figures confirm our worst fears,\" said Ms Davies. She said the \"nursing workforce is in crisis\". But there were drops across other subjects - particularly among older students not applying directly from school. Among 19-year-olds, numbers were down 9%. And among 25-year-olds, applications were down 23%. But among 18-year-olds, such as sixth-formers applying from school, numbers have continued to rise to record levels, up to 37% of the age group. And there could be an upside for those who are seeking places - with universities likely to be competing to attract students.

The medical director of the NHS, Bruce Keogh, said it was \"a highly responsible precautionary step\". But some people have questioned the decision and its timing, 24 hours after a High Court ruling kept surgery there. Leeds General Infirmary had been earmarked for closure by the NHS review to concentrate children's heart surgery in fewer bigger centres. But that decision was quashed by a High Court judge on Wednesday. Stuart Andrew, Conservative MP for Pudsey, who has led a cross-party campaign to keep the unit open, said it was a \"very odd\" decision coming after the jubilation that greeted the court ruling. \"We have always asked them 'is it safe at Leeds?' and the answer always came back 'yes it is'. \"What is the information that says that has changed?\" Congenital heart defects explained He added he had not received one complaint about care. Children who would have been treated in Leeds will be sent to other hospitals around England. Affected families are being contacted directly by the trust and the review is expected to take three weeks. Anne Keatley-Clarke, chief executive of the Children's Heart Federation, an umbrella group for different voluntary organisations, said she had raised concerns about surgery outcomes two years ago, and more recently parents had reported difficulties in getting referrals at Leeds to other heart units.

Among them is Prof Jordan Nash from Imperial College London, who is working on the CMS experiment at the LHC. \"We are opening a new window on the Universe and looking forward to seeing what's there,\" he said. \"As much as we have a lot of theories of what might be out there we don't know. We'd love to find something completely unexpected and we might, and that's the exciting bit.\" They want a glimpse into a world never seen before. By smashing atoms harder than they have been smashed before physicists hope to peel back another veil of reality. The aim of the various theories of physics is to explain how the Universe was formed and how the bits that make it up work. One of the most successful of these theories is called the \"Standard Model\". It explains how the world of the very, very small works. Just as the world became very strange when Alice shrunk after drinking a potion in the children's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, physicists have found things are quite different when they study the goings on at scales that are even smaller than the size of an atom. By doubling the energy of the LHC, it will enable them to discover new characters in the wonderful and mysterious tale of how the Universe works and came to be. The Standard Model describes how the basic building blocks that make up atoms and the forces of nature interact. And just as in Alice's stories it features some eccentric characters, notably a family of 17 elementary particles. Some are familiar from school physics lessons, household names if you like. One of the best known in the sub-atomic world is perhaps the electron, which orbits the atom and is involved in electricity and magnetism. Another flashy A-lister is the photon, which is a particle of light. But most particles from the Standard Model family are more niche, a little more art house if you like, and have strange names. In fact, one of them is actually called \"the strange quark\". And others from this group of particles are named as if by thoughtless and unimaginative parents\n",

Police justified the decision saying it was operating under a false licence. The closure comes amid concerns amongst hardliners about growing Western influence in Iran as relations with a number of countries improve. \"The shutting down of Halal KFC was due to a misunderstanding,\" Abbas Pazuki, the manager of Halal KFC, told the Tasnim News Agency. He said police had thought the restaurant was a branch of the American KFC. \"We are part of a brand known as Halal KFC, which comes from Turkey. It belongs to Muslims and its target market is Muslim nations,\" said Pazuki. He said the Turkish brand was a \"rival of the American KFC\". Earlier reports suggested the authorities closed down the first branch in Tehran of the better known KFC. Ali Fazeli, head of the Iranian chamber of commerce, confirmed that the Iranian KFC has no connection with KFC in the US, according to ILNA press agency. \"In accordance with orders from the Supreme Leader, we do not give any authorisation to Western brands\" in the fast food sector, Fazeli said. The state media reported the opening of the restaurant as a first sign of creeping US influence, the BBC's Kasra Naji says. Hardliners believe the recent agreement on curbing Iran's nuclear programme, reached between Iran and Western powers, may become a vehicle for softening Iran's anti-Americanism, opening the floodgates of foreign influences, our correspondent adds.

As part of its relocation Wasps did not just move into, but acquired, the Ricoh Arena stadium complex in the West Midlands city for £20m. The fact that the Barbadian artist - famous for hit singles like Umbrella, We Found Love, and Diamonds - is kicking off her high-profile tour in their stadium is a source of pride to club executives, and an indication of how far financially as well as geographically they have come. It also illustrates how the Premiership club sees its new commercial model as being as much about leisure as it is about sport. \"The entertainment side is where we see the biggest commercial growth,\" Wasps Group chief executive David Armstrong tells me. It was 13 months ago that Wasps, then based in Buckinghamshire, announced they would play their home games at the Ricoh Arena, completing the stadium purchase a month later. Their first game as owners of their new home was a win against London Irish in December 2014. A year on, the club is no longer the tenant of Wycombe Wanderers football club, but a multi-venue, multi-use business. Moving a major sporting \"franchise\" lock, stock and barrel from one city to another is not uncommon in the United States, but in the more conservative UK, such uprooting is greeted with suspicion. \"The primary reason for moving was commercial,\" Mr Armstrong said, speaking to the BBC at the annual Rugby Expo conference at Twickenham. \"We were looking to create a stable long-term business model that would take us forward over the next 250 years,\" he adds, referring to the length of their Ricoh lease. \"With our previous business model, we were losing in the region of £3m to £4m a year. Our only revenue then was ticket sales. Food and beverage sales went to the football club, while other revenue went to our sponsors. \"We were a shell of a club, and couldn't be competitive and make money.\" As well as its new income strands, earlier this year, the club raised £\n",

The web attack enrolled thousands of devices that make up the internet of things - smart devices used to oversee homes and which can be controlled remotely.

The recall affects all the circuit boards and components made by Hangzhou Xiongmai that go into webcams. It is not clear how effective the recall will be in reducing the numbers of vulnerable devices hackers can call on to mount attacks. Yes, and it probably will.

As he headed back towards Tobermory on the wrong side of the road his hire car smashed into the van driven by Miss Wade.

Dozens of people are said to have been killed during the combined assaults. IS members recaptured the city on Sunday, hours after Russian air strikes appeared to have driven them back. Sources in Hama province reported seeing dead bodies with no visible injuries, according to the UK-based group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The death toll was put at at least 40 by one citizens' group in Hama province. The Syrian government and its Russian backers have previously denied using chemical weapons. IS was previously driven out of the ancient desert city of Palmyra in March with the support of Russian air strikes, but the jihadist group seized it again in a sudden assault that started last week. The surprise setback for Syrian government forces came as they and their allies turned their attention to fighting local opposition forces in Aleppo and Damascus. IS destroyed a number of monuments and beheaded the archaeological director during its 10-month occupation of the Unesco World Heritage site and the adjacent city of Tadmur. Two 2,000-year-old temples, an arch and funerary towers were left in ruins.

Nissin, which Premier describes as a \"long-term shareholder\", is expected to take a seat on the Premier board. McCormick, known for its Schwartz spices and Lawry's seasonings, first made a bid of 52p a share last month and then raised it to 60p a share on 14 March. Premier rejected it \"on the basis that it significantly undervalued the company and its prospects\".

McCormick said \"it would be an outstanding custodian for the Premier Foods brands and, can provide benefits for Premier Foods, its pensioners, creditors and other stakeholders, which Premier Foods' current capital structure cannot deliver.\" Some shareholders are keen for Premier to seek a higher offer. David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, the fund arm of insurer Standard Life, which controls 7% of Premier, said: \"Although we believe the 60p bid indicated by McCormick is too low, we remain open to a bid at a higher level. \"We expect the Premier Foods Board, on behalf of its shareholders, to engage with McCormick and pursue this option to the full.\" Premier shares have been on a roller coaster ride this week, soaring 50% on Wednesday following news of the McCormick bid, falling by more than 10% on Thursday on the announcement of the Nissin stake and then recouping nearly all their losses as McCormick said it might be prepared to pay more.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission looked into police actions. An inquest found 14 DJ announcements in 30 minutes had been the most significant cause of overcrowding. About 900 students travelled to the club from around the country and the DJs called for universities to leave one after the other, often with just a few minutes between them. The IPCC investigation found it more than likely police had not been informed of the event and was only alerted when a large number of people began arriving at the club. The report said there is \"sufficient evidence to suggest the decisions and actions of the police during the incident were appropriate\". It added there was \"no evidence of a criminal offence having been committed by any police officer\". The report concluded that \"every officer involved made a significant contribution to the effective policing of the tragedy\". During an inquest last week, it was reported that a series of announcements reminding people not to miss their coaches had been made in the early hours of 19 October. The inquest jury concluded the second most significant factor was the lack of overall management of the cloakroom. The Crown Prosecution Service previously determined there would be no criminal charges brought against anyone following the incident. Ms Nanfuka, of Neasden, north London, was studying a leisure and tourism degree at the University of Northampton. She died at Northampton General Hospital on 19 October.

The phone has been manufactured by Foxconn in China. Light Phone describes its product as a supplement phone, designed to help people \"step away\" from the distractions offered by smartphones when convenient. \"The phone is a very casual phone - if you're expecting an urgent call from your pregnant wife you shouldn't bring your Light Phone with you,\" founder Joe Hollier told the BBC.

Kidman said while she doesn't have to work, she does so because of her passion for cinema. The star of The Killing of the Sacred Deer, in competition at Cannes, said her young children will be banned from seeing the dark psychological thriller. Kidman has two grown-up children from her marriage to Tom Cruise and two younger daughters with her current husband singer Keith Urban. \"My (younger) children have very little understanding of what me or my husband do. Their lives are obviously far more important!\" She added: \"I'm at that stage in my life where I still try to act as if I'm 21 and starting my career. \"At this stage of my life, I'm just trying to stay very bold and open and try things and support film-makers I believe in.\" The Killing of the Sacred Deer features an eminent surgeon Steven Murphy - played by Colin Farrell - who adopts a teenager into his family. Things start to go horribly wrong when the boy turns against Murphy. Kidman plays ophthalmologist Anna Murphy, who is married to Steven. It's directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek filmmaker behind indie hit The Lobster, which won the Jury Prize at Cannes two years ago. Farrell also starred in that film.

Michael, from Larbert in Stirlingshire, has Duchenne muscular dystrophy - a severe condition causing irreversible muscle damage. Few born with it survive to their 30th birthday. He took part in a clinical trial during the development of Translarna, a drug tackling the underlying causes of the disease which has been approved by the EU. Michael wrote to Ms Sturgeon explaining about his condition and asking for her to \"help boys to keep walking\". The first minister said she was able to explain to Michael that the assessment procedure had to be \"entirely independent of government\". She also criticised the pharmaceutical firm which developed the drug, PTC Therapeutics, for taking time to submit its proposal to the SMC. Ms Sturgeon said: \"It was an absolute delight to meet Michael today, he's a really impressive and brave young man campaigning not just for himself but for other young boys with Duchenne. \"We were disappointed that the pharmaceutical company took so long to put forward a submission on this drug to the Scottish Medicines Consortium and we have previously urged them to put forward a good quality submission with a fair offering of price. \"This government has taken a number of significant steps to improve access to new treatments for patients with rare conditions.\" Robert Meadowcroft, chief executive of Muscular Dystrophy UK, said: \"We are delighted that Michael was able to deliver his amazing, heartfelt letter to Nicola Sturgeon in person, an opportunity that doesn't come every day. \"The meeting means a great deal to the Youngs, and other families who live with Duchenne muscular dystrophy across Scotland. \"It is wonderful that the first minister gave up her time in support of Michael, and we hope their meeting will lead to positive discussions with the Scottish Medicines Consortium about Translarna.\" The Scottish Medicines Consortium is expected to come to a decision on the use of the drug in March.\n",

According to the most recent comparable statistics, migration to the UK from the rest of the EU was 257,000 in the year to September 2015, but during the same period, 655,000 EU nationals registered for National Insurance numbers (Ninos). Mr Farage smells a rat: \"They are pulling the wool over our eyes. Ninos are a simple and clear reflection of the real numbers of people in this country, as without them you can neither legally work, nor claim benefits.\" Now the government has promised to tell us how many of the Ninos issued are still active - in other words, how many of the EU citizens who registered are currently paying UK tax or claiming benefits. But are Ninos a good measure of immigration? There is no question that the official immigration figures, based on a survey taken at ports and airports, are imprecise, with the ONS 95% confident that the immigration figure is within plus or minus 23,000 of the true figure. More importantly, though, the ONS figures only aim to measure long-term migration. They use the UN's definition of a long-term migrant as someone who moves country for a year or more. When it comes to National Insurance numbers, on the other hand, there is no minimum stay in the UK. Everyone who wants to work in the UK must have a National Insurance number, even if they're only working in the country for a few weeks. What's more, Ninos are unique to an individual, so once you've received one, it's yours forever. This means that not all those who HMRC reveal to be \"active\" will necessarily belong to people who have been in the country continuously since their number was issued - they could have left and returned. The ONS statistics also include people who are not planning to work or claim benefits, such as children or non-working partners. These people don't need a Nino when they arrive, but can apply for one in the future. This means someone registering for a Nino could have arrived at any time, not necessarily in the year or quarter in question. It\n",

The vote against Conservative ministers' Trade Union Bill is not legally binding. The UK and Welsh governments disagree over whether the assembly's permission is needed before the new rules apply to public sector workers in Wales. The bill would require at least half of union members to take part in a ballot before a strike can happen. In public services such as health, education and the fire service, industrial action would need at least 40% of eligible union members to vote in favour. The Conservatives say the bill should apply to the whole of Britain, but Welsh government ministers say the assembly's consent is needed. On Tuesday, AMs withheld their approval of the bill by voting down a motion in the Senedd chamber. Labour has said it will try to overturn the bill if the UK government ignores the assembly' vote and pushes ahead. If returned to power at May's assembly election, Labour would introduce its own legislation to repeal the bill. Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews said: \"In Wales we have a good record of resolving disputes. \"There was no junior doctors' strike in Wales, there was in England. \"Fire fighters took industrial action in England over pensions, they were not doing so in Wales. \"In contrast, we believe this bill, the Trade Union Bill, will lead to a confrontational relationship between employers and the workforce.\" Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said he supported the role of trade unions in standing up for members. But, referring to the general secretary of the Unite union, he said: \"Where I will not stand up and support is for Len McCluskey, or his mob, to use you lot [Labour AMs] to live their ambitions.\" He added: \"Where there is a discrepancy I would suggest is where general secretaries of unions choose to live their political dreams on the back of their members' subs, and that clearly is not acceptable.\"\n",

Earlier ATL general secretary Mary Bousted called the plan \"madness\". On Monday, School Minister Nick Gibb said the plan made schools \"profession-led\" - though he faced some heckling. Under the plan almost 17,000 schools which have not already converted to academy status - mostly primaries - must do so by 2020 or have committed to do so by 2022. Delegates applauded as the ATL became the third teachers' union to oppose the plans. The conference, meeting in Liverpool, voted to condemn the White Paper, Educational Excellence Everywhere, as \"an attack on democracy\". Proposing the motion, Mark Baker said White Paper's proposals amounted to \"Educational Excellence All Over The Place\". The motion warned that conversion of schools to academy status would be achieved without regard to the wishes of parents, staff or local communities and without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. The move represented \"ever greater centralism and micro-management\". \"It takes no account of the growing evidence of failing academies but insists on a blind adherence to an ideology with no foundation in fact,\" said the motion. The ATL will now work with \"all those concerned\", including other education unions to opposed forced academisation and to consider what forms of action - including potential industrial action - may be needed. In her speech to conference on Tuesday morning, Dr Bousted backed calls for a co-ordinated response. \"Alone we can do something. Together we can do great things. \"We must fight together to protect our profession, for the sake of the children and young people whose education depends on us. \"And we will fight and if we fight together, with parents and councillors, with other unions, with politicians, with governors, with the whole of civil society which opposes the madness of forced academisation, then we will win,\" Dr Bousted concluded.

            "Input: summarize: Bakir Izetbegovic, a member of Bosnia's tripartite presidency, said he was seeking \"truth and justice\". Bosnian Serb officials warned the move would trigger a \"serious crisis\" in the country. In 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) cleared Serbia of direct responsibility for genocide. The ICJ found only one act of genocide during Bosnia's 1992-95 war - the massacre of about 8,000 Bosnian Muslim (Bosniak) men and boys by Bosnian Serb forces in the town of Srebrenica in 1995. It was Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two. The ICJ ruled that Serbia had violated international law by failing to prevent the killings, but absolved it of direct responsibility. On Thursday, Mr Izetbegovic told reporters that \"the request [for a review] is being submitted at this very moment\". \"I think that I am on the path of truth and justice,\" he added. The appeal was launched before a 10-year deadline expires on 26 February. Mladen Ivanic, the Serb member of the presidency, said the move should have been made collectively by the tripartite body, where a Bosnian Croat also has a seat. \"I am afraid that we have entered a really serious crisis,\" Mr Ivanic said. Meanwhile, Serbia Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic earlier described Mr Izetbegovic's intentions as \"bad\" for relations between the two countries.

Passengers on the train said there had been a loud bang followed by a jolt that made some people on the train fall down. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said the train was travelling at a \"fairly slow speed\" when it failed to stop on time and struck a buffer at the station. The impact was hard enough, however, to smash some of the train's windows and crease its doors.

A 55% rise in oil prices in the first quarter of 2017 compared with a year earlier was the main driver of profits. Excluding one-off items, profits on the CCS measure were $3.86bn, up 136%. Shell joins rivals BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Total in reporting better-than-expected results. More than $1bn in cost savings and budget cuts made over the past three years from cost-cuts and assets sales have also helped to increase cash flow and boost profits. But Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said the company would be making $25bn worth of investments this year in new oil and gas projects. \"We continue to reshape Shell's portfolio and to transform the company,\" he said in a statement. Oil and gas production, known as upstream, rose 2% in the quarter to 3.752 million barrels of oil equivalent from 3.905 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. A number of new fields continued to ramp up output, particularly in Brazil and Kazakhstan. Earnings from refining, marketing and chemicals also rose 20% to $2.5bn. \"We saw notable improvements in upstream and chemicals, which benefited from improved operational performance and better market conditions,\" Mr van Beurden said. Investors welcomed the results, marking Shell's shares up 3% at the start of trading. Energy producers across the world are reaping the benefits of higher oil prices, which have strongly increased their revenues and profits.

Muslims and Hindus should have \"the most important days in their faiths recognised in law\", the petition says. The government has already rejected the e-petitioners' request. In its response to the petition, the government said: \"We are very aware of the importance of these festivals which are widely celebrated in the UK. \"Whilst we appreciate a new national holiday may benefit some communities and sectors, the cost to the economy remains considerable and any changes to the current arrangements would not take place without a full consultation.\" Mr Blackman pressed ministers to reconsider during a debate in the House of Commons' secondary debating chamber of Westminster Hall. He said the government's concern about cost was \"valid\". The MP for Harrow East said: \"According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research, each public holiday costs £2.3bn per day due to a loss of retail, commercial services, and other industries. \"So we're looking at an overall economic cost of just under £5bn if the Muslim faith and the Hindu faith were to be given one specified public holiday each, if the estimate is correct.\" But, he continued, the think tank had also estimated that annual output would be raised by £19bn \"if all public holidays were scrapped\". \"That's not likely to happen. I can't believe any government would every dare to decide to cancel Christmas,\" Mr Blackman said. \"So we can't make a case for or against further public holidays just on the basis of money.

Current government plans include some tunnels but leaves about eight miles in exposed or partially-covered cuttings. HS2 said it had \"considered\" further tunnelling but stood by its plans. Plans for the HS2 between London and Birmingham and then to Manchester and Leeds have been developed by the government under holding company HS2 Ltd. It promises to reduce journey times between Birmingham and London from 81 to 49 minutes, and slash the trip to Manchester by an hour, to 68 minutes. The new Chilterns Long Tunnel Route report, produced by Peter Brett Associates, was commissioned by Chiltern District Council, Aylesbury Vale District Council, Buckinghamshire County Council and the Chilterns Conservation Board to look at alternative proposals. The group said the planned route through the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) would result in an \"adverse and irreversible impact\" on the landscape. HS2 Ltd's proposal includes about 13km (8 miles) in a tunnel from the M25 to Little Missenden and 12km (7.5 miles) on two viaducts, in two green tunnels and either on embankments or in cuttings. The new plan includes a 24.2km (15 mile) tunnel from the M25 to Wendover, the first 9km (5.5 miles) of which would follow the exact alignment of the government scheme. The report concluded a long tunnel was \"technically feasible\", would protect the landscape and \"be a better route operationally\". It is the second time the group has proposed a tunnel scheme but it said the latest proposal would have less impact on the countryside. The cost is estimated at £1.85bn, as opposed to the government's £1.45bn plan, but campaigners said this was \"a small price to pay\" to \"preserve a beautiful and unique part of the countryside\". HS2 spokesman Ben Ruse said the firm was \"committed to protecting the environment\" and a tunnel through the entire AONB had been \"explored and given extensive consideration\".

UK teenagers had a below average satisfaction score of seven. But anxiety about exams and bullying remains a problem for many young people. And heavy internet use leaves many feeling lonely and less satisfied. The findings are based on a survey of 540,000 students internationally who also completed the OECD Pisa tests in science, mathematics and reading in 2015. The study reveals large variations in life satisfaction out of 48 OECD countries and partner nations. The highest levels of satisfaction were found in the Dominican Republic (8.5), Mexico (8.3) and Costa Rica (8.2), while the Asian countries or economies of Korea (6.4), Hong Kong (6.5), Macau (6.6) and Taiwan (6.6) recorded low levels of satisfaction. The UK took 38th place for life satisfaction, behind countries such as Russia (7.8), Bulgaria (7.4) and Estonia (7.5). The study found girls and disadvantaged students were less likely than boys and advantaged students to report high levels of life satisfaction. Despite reasonably high average levels of satisfaction, bullying was a significant problem for many youngsters, with a large proportion saying they had been victims. On average across OECD countries, about 11% of teenagers said they were frequently mocked, 7% were \"left out of things\" and 8% were the subject of hurtful rumours. Around 4% of students - approximately one child per class - reported that they were hit or pushed at least a few times per month. But the OECD research found less bullying in schools where students had positive relationships with their teachers. Exam stress was also a problem, with 59% of students saying they often worried that taking a test would be difficult and 66% saying they worried about getting poor grades. Across OECD countries, about 55% of students said they were very anxious before a test, even if they were well prepared for it. Girls had a tendency to worry more than boys, with girls in all 72 countries reporting greater levels of schoolwork-related anxiety than boys.

The move was based on further analysis of radar data that showed the plane was going faster, thus using more fuel. The Beijing-bound airliner disappeared on 8 March with 239 people on board. Malaysian officials have concluded that, based on satellite data, it flew into the sea somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. So far no trace of it has been found. Search efforts had until Friday morning focused on an area some 2,500km (1,550 miles) to the south-west of the Australian city of Perth. Did previous photos show plane debris? Using satellite images, several nations have identified objects floating in the sea in that search area, but these have not been located and there is no evidence that they are related to the plane. John Young, general manager of Amsa's emergency response division, said that teams had \"moved on\" from that area based on the new information. Acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that the fact that the search area had moved did not discount the earlier satellite images of possible debris further south. \"Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week,\" Mr Hussein said. A statement from Amsa - which is co-ordinating the search - said the new information had come from the international investigation team in Malaysia. This was based on \"continuing analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca before radar contact was lost\", Amsa said. \"It indicated that the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated, resulting in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance the aircraft travelled south into the Indian Ocean.\" It said that the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) had determined that this was \"the most credible lead to where debris may be located\". The new search area is about 1,850km west of Perth and covers some 319,000 sq km (123,000 sq miles).

Net migration - immigration minus emigration - was the second-highest number on record. Immigration minister Robert Goodwill said the government was \"committed to getting net migration down\". Most of the period covered by the figures was before the EU referendum, but they also include one week after the poll. The ONS says the net migration figure is similar to the previous year, although it was up slightly on the 12 months ending in March, when it stood at 326,000. Immigration to the UK has also risen to a record level with 650,000 migrants in the year to June. Net migration from the EU was the highest figure on record with the number standing at 189,000. Mr Goodwill said the British people had sent out a \"clear message\" they want more control on immigration and the government was committed to getting numbers down to \"the tens of thousands\". He added: \"That is why reducing the number of migrants coming to the UK will be a key priority of our negotiations to leave the EU.\" Figures show 311,000 people came to live in the UK for work-related reasons. But the ONS said there was a \"statistically significant\" rise in the number of people who were \"looking for work\", 130,000, compared to 107,000 last year, as opposed to those who had a definite job to go to. By Danny Shaw, BBC Home Affairs correspondent The latest ONS figures have brought the government no Christmas cheer. Immigration remains at historically high levels - and its target to get net migration to less than 100,000 remains a long way off. Ministers hope the numbers will come down once they're able to exert more control over EU migration, currently at a record 284,000, when the UK leaves the Union. However, that all depends on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations: will there be new restrictions on the ability of EU citizens to move freely from state to state? One approach that might be considered is to limit travel to those who've got a firm offer of employment. It won't have escaped the Home Office's notice that 82,000 EU migrants hadn't secured a job when they came to Britain - they arrived in order to look for work.

Yet the secret of their amazing climbing ability remained a mystery until relatively recently. The underside of a gecko's foot looks like a tyre tread and is covered in millions of microscopic hairs. Each hair splits into hundreds of tips just 200 billionths of a metre wide. The secret of this lizard's adhesion turns out to be the relatively weak intermolecular forces that draw materials together any time they get close. These van der Waals forces nevertheless explain how a gecko can support its own body weight on just one finger, and a single gecko hair can lift the weight of an ant. To un-stick, the gecko pulls its foot away at a different angle. \"What we're talking about is something that is about as sticky as sticky tape - it's not crazy glue,\" says Prof Kellar Autumn, who became intrigued by gecko adhesion after being funded to develop climbing robots by the US military. Prof Autumn, from Lewis & Clark College in Oregon, added: \"What is special about it is that it is controllable. And its controllability is based on geometry and physics, not chemistry.\" The effort to uncover the mechanisms behind gecko climbing has already yielded synthetic material that sticks in the same way. Stick, peel and re-stick a piece of existing adhesive tape several times and it quickly loses its clingy properties. Prof Autumn and Mark Cutkosky, from Stanford University, compared natural and polymer-based synthetic gecko hairs using a machine that simulated gecko climbing. This showed both versions could be re-used some 30,000 times without losing their stickiness. Synthetic adhesives could yield transformative applications in robotics, industry, medicine, sports and clothing. But one possible use always comes up in any popular discussion: could they allow humans to scale walls like Spider-Man?

Another group of musically-trained children were found to be better at processing sounds and language. The research is being presented to the American Psychological Association. The research was led by Dr Nina Kraus at Northwestern University and involved hundreds of children at high schools in impoverished areas of Chicago and Los Angeles. Her research had previously highlighted that learning music could improve the concentration, memory and focus of children in the classroom by improving their neural functions. But much of the research had focused on the impact of music lessons on relatively affluent children. In this study, Dr Kraus found that giving children regular group music lessons for five or more hours a week prevented any decline in reading skills, which would normally be expected in poorer areas. Another group of teenage schoolchildren, from a poor area of Chicago, took part in band practice or choir practice every day at school as part of a music project. Researchers recorded their brainwaves to assess how they responded to speech sounds. After two years of musical training, the results showed the musical group was faster and more accurate at distinguishing one sound from another, particularly when there was background noise, compared to a group that did not participate in any musical activity. Dr Kraus said this showed music could have a positive impact on the brain, which could also help learning, but it was not a quick fix. \"Research has shown that there are differences in the brains of children raised in impoverished environments that affect their ability to learn,\" he explained. \"While more affluent students do better in school than children from lower income backgrounds, we are finding that musical training can alter the nervous system to create a better learner and help offset this academic gap.\" All the children had similar IQs and reading ability at the start of the study. Dr Kraus said music appeared to remodel the brain to improve the connections between sounds and meaning, the process by which babies learn to speak. Children growing up in poorer areas with poorly-educated mothers are more likely to have 'noisier brains', she said. This is because they are less likely to know and recognise a wide range of words and are therefore less able to respond to sounds and language. \"Music automatically sharpen\n",

It has been estimated that the road improvements could reduce the average daily car commute between Glasgow and Edinburgh by 20 minutes.\n",

            "Input: summarize: Making them vote may halt declining election turnouts and could \"kick start the habit of a lifetime\", the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said. In 2010, 44% of 18 to 24-year-olds voted, with the \"younger and poorer\" least likely to vote, it suggested. The UK risks \"sleepwalking into a more divided democracy\" unless there is reform, the IPPR's Mat Lawrence said. \"The working class and the young have less input into political decision-making processes, with lower rates of participation and representation than older and more affluent citizens,\" the IPPR report suggested. Such inequalities undermined the \"legitimacy and effectiveness\" of democracy, the report claimed, saying it was unlikely the trend would be reversed in next month's general election. At the 1970 general election, the gap between the proportion of 18-24 year olds and over-65s who voted was 18%. However, at the 2010 general election, the gap had risen to 32% - with 76% of over-65s voting, compared to 44% of 18-24 year olds. \"Long-run decline in voter turnout in the UK is being driven by the relative collapse in participation among the young and the less well-off - not by a uniform decline in turnout among all groups,\" Mr Lawrence added. \"A distinctive non-voting population, generally younger and poorer, heightens political inequality by giving some groups far greater influence at the ballot box.\" The report comes after the voting age was reduced to 16 for the Scottish independence referendum, in September - when 109,593 16 and 17-year-olds registered to vote. Mr Lawrence said the high turnout at the referendum, as well as the rise of grassroots groups, provided reasons for optimism. Broadcaster and author Rick Edwards told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he supported the proposal, saying \"something drastic needs to happen\" to encourage young people to vote. But he said there would have to be a \"none of the above\" option on ballot papers, to allow voters to express their dissatisfaction. \"The problem is politicians are more interested in serving the interests of the demographic who vote more because they are interested in winning their votes and keeping their votes. \"Therefore what is happening is that young\n",

In Russia, the three main pro-Kremlin TV channels have not reported the story so far. This is quite typical behaviour for Russia's mainstream broadcasters, which often steer clear of controversial topics involving Russian leaders. The leak reveals a suspected money-laundering ring run by a Russian bank and involving close associates of President Vladimir Putin. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations: \"Even though Vladimir Putin is not explicitly mentioned anywhere, it is obvious for us that our president has been and will be the main target.\" The story is covered by privately owned business channel RBK and independent digital news channel Dozhd TV - sources that seldom shy away from major international stories that cast Russia in an unfavourable light. The ICIJ report was released late on Sunday night in Moscow, missing print deadlines for newspapers. But the ICIJ's Russian partner, the opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, featured a seven-page hard copy report and a large online version on its website. Since then, most of the popular online news sources have included reports on the story. There has been plenty of chatter on social media. The hashtag #panamapapers has been in and out of the Top 10 Twitter trends for Russia since Sunday evening. It seems the story has underwhelmed many Russian bloggers, who were not surprised to learn about potential large-scale corruption. There have been plenty of sarcastic jokes about the alleged sums involved. In Germany, Munich's Sueddeutsche Zeitung - which originally received the documents - has the online headline \"Putin's rich friends - the trail of the secret money\". The heavyweight Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung says \"Panama's state prosecutors investigate offshore firms\", while Berlin's Die Welt reports on \"The billion-dollar trails of a global affair\".

In the latest post on the company's Facebook page, an infant in heels sits astride a miniature motorbike with the caption: \"This little #Diva, defining cool posing in her #PeeWeePumps.\" The image was criticised by a number the site's users, who suggested it was \"wrong\" and \"disgusting\" to portray infants in such a way.

Another commenter, Jen, said that \"promoting products for babies this way is just sick\".

The shortest waiting time was in Terminal 4, where it took four minutes for passengers from the EU to clear the checks and two minutes for non-EU nationals. BAA said on Friday the longest wait passengers had was 77 minutes at Terminal 3, 75 minutes at Terminal 4, and 54 minutes at Terminals 5 and 1, with non-EU passengers facing the longest wait at the time.

            "Input: summarize: At first sight, with billions in subsidies, you might think that every farmer would automatically want to keep the cash flowing and therefore choose to stay in. But it's not so simple. In 2014, the most recent year with confirmed figures, UK farms received £3.19bn. The average payment was £17,735. The highest was almost £2m. For many farmers, particularly those working marginal land such as hills with poor soil, the subsidies act as a lifeline. Mark Williams runs a farm perched on steep slopes near Welshpool in Wales with a spectacular view over the Severn Valley. Sitting on his quad bike, a flock of sheep grazing nearby, he describes the payments as essential to keep communities like his going. He says hill farming is very difficult and that the margins on beef and sheep alone are very tight, \"so the subsidy is very important to protect those farms\". But travel the short distance from the Welsh uplands to the rich soils of Shropshire near Telford and you hear a very different story. Bruce Udale and his daughter Isabel Moseley, who grow animal feed on their 1,200 acres, are both determined to leave the EU. This is farming on an industrial scale, with huge fields and impressive machinery. We watch a giant tractor extend two vast arms to spray a bright green crop of wheat. The farm attracts tens of thousands of pounds in CAP payments, but Bruce and Isabel are convinced that British farmers would be better off without them. In their view, the subsidies swirling through the agricultural economy artificially inflate prices which means - according to Bruce - that the payments are not worth as much as they sound. \"If we don't have subsidies\", he says, \"I believe our costs would come down. Land values would probably come down, rents would certainly come down, machinery costs would come down because a lot of these things are priced at what the market thinks we've got in our pockets. \"So the loss would not be as great as many people think.\" And, because the payments come from the EU via the UK government, there is notorious bureaucracy. Isabel says it's hugely time-consuming and she resents it. \"For our children's future we should take things back in hand, make our own rules and regulations in Great\n",

Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced the measure on Monday, saying she was asserting sovereignty over Argentina's energy resources. Her government is taking 51% of YPF, wiping out Repsol's 57.4% majority stake. The move has wide support in Argentina but has provoked outrage in Spain, which has threatened reprisals. The Spanish government will consider what measures to take at a cabinet meeting on Friday, and has also been rallying international support. \"There are going to be very clear interventions on the part of the European Union,\" Trade Secretary Jaime Garcia Legaz said, without revealing further details. It is not clear what any reprisals might involve. EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said Spain would also raise the issue with the IMF, the World Bank and the G-20. \"We will try to pressurise Argentina so that it sees that this road is going nowhere,\" he said after meeting Hillary Clinton.

Repsol has said it wants around $10bn for its stake in YPF, but Argentina has said it does not accept that valuation.

In his profile on the LinkedIn social media website, Mr Duffus said he had been employed by Blue Hackle since 2005, and was working as a site security manager. He had previously served in the armed forces for nine years. The Kabul police chief told the BBC the four insurgents, who were all killed, had a truck full of explosives.

The US is trying to bolster its relationship with its Pacific allies, as China asserts territorial claims. But Mr Obama said the embargo decision was not related to US policy on China. \"It's based on our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards normalisation with Vietnam,\" he said in Hanoi. Vietnam is one of several countries in the region involved in maritime disputes with China. The US insists on the right to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. In 2014, a row over a Chinese oil rig near the Paracel islands led to clashes between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels and anti-China riots in Vietnam. Why Vietnam wants US weapons Beijing's new South China Sea islands High hopes for Obama visit White House officials had indicated the arms ban, in force since 1984, would be lifted only if human rights in Vietnam improved. \"Sales will need to still meet strict requirements, including those related to human rights, but this change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself,\" Mr Obama said after talks with President Tran Dai Quang. Vietnam had been arguing for an end to the embargo, which was partially lifted in 2014. President Obama's easing of all remaining restrictions on arms sales to Vietnam is powerfully symbolic. But what does it mean in practice? Up to now, Vietnam has relied on Russia to supply most of its defence equipment, a legacy of the Cold War, when they were allies. The government would certainly like to diversify its sources, and is looking at a number of potential alternative suppliers. But it won't be rushing into the arms of US manufacturers just yet. One reason is that a lot of US technology may be too sophisticated and expensive for Vietnam's needs. And while Vietnam's defence spending, which has doubled over the past decade, is driven by the rivalry with its giant neighbour China, it will not want to antagonise China by seeking state-of-the-art US weapons that might alter the military balance. Another reason is the complicated process of procuring US weapons. In his announcement, Mr Obama said any military contracts would still be subject to provisos on human rights, and given\n",

They will inevitably look to captain and record goal-scorer Cristiano Ronaldo for inspiration, and his duel with Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale has been the subject of much attention in the build-up to the game. Another Real player, centre-back Pepe, could have an important role to play as Portugal aim to subdue the threat of Bale, who is second in the Euro 2016 scoring charts with three goals. Pepe returned to training on Tuesday having struggled with a thigh injury and, with the defender's confrontational style in mind, Coleman was asked about potential gamesmanship from Portugal. \"Our boys will know about the opposition. We do our homework on every team. We know their players individually and collectively, we know what to expect,\" he said. \"You call it gamesmanship, but sometimes it's being streetwise at\n",

            "Input: summarize: Researchers assessing the results of nearly 200 studies say sperm counts among men from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, seem to have halved in less than 40 years. Some experts are sceptical of the Human Reproduction Update findings. But lead researcher Dr Hagai Levine said he was \"very worried\" about what might happen in the future. The assessment, one of the largest ever undertaken, brings together the results of 185 studies between 1973 and 2011. Dr Levine, an epidemiologist, told the BBC that if the trend continued humans would become extinct. \"If we will not change the ways that we are living and the environment and the chemicals that we are exposed to, I am very worried about what will happen in the future,\" he said. \"Eventually we may have a problem, and with reproduction in general, and it may be the extinction of the human species.\" Scientists not involved in the study have praised the quality of the research but say that it may be premature to come to such a conclusion. Dr Levine, from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, found a 52.4% decline in sperm concentration, and a 59.3% decline in total sperm count in men from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The study also indicates the rate of decline among men living in these countries is continuing and possibly even increasing. In contrast, no significant decline was seen in South America, Asia and Africa, but the researchers point out that far fewer studies have been conducted on these continents. However, Dr Levine is concerned that eventually sperm counts could fall in these places too. Many previous studies have indicated similar sharp declines in sperm count in developed economies, but sceptics say that a large proportion of them have been flawed. Some have investigated a relatively small number of men, or included only men who attend fertility clinics and are, in any case, more likely to have low sperm counts. There is also concern that studies that claim to show a decline in sperm counts are more likely to get published in scientific journals than those that do not. Another difficulty is that early methods of counting sperm may have overestimated the true count. Taken together these factors may have created a false view of falling sperm counts. But the researchers claim to have accounted for some of these deficiencies,\n",

The film - \"a work of cinematic art\" according to The Guardian - made more than £1m (1,346 euros) at the French box office, was nominated for four prestigious Cesar awards and secured an international film release. Girlhood is the story of a black teenager, Marieme, who lives in the vast banlieues, or suburbs, of Paris. With a dead-end future in front of her, she forms a relationship with a group of other young girls. None of its leads, including Parisienne Karidja Toure who plays Marieme, had ever acted before - a consequence, says director Celine Sciamma, of her not being able to find enough professional black actresses for the roles. \"We were looking for four months,\" she recalls, \"with a casting director and two assistants. We basically went everywhere. \"We went to agencies, but there were very few black girls. And then we went in to theatre classes and high schools, but we met most of our cast randomly on the street. \"We had to invent a group, with its alchemy and energy. But we also needed girls with wit, who were able to improvise, because some of the scenes required it. \"All the girls are non-professionals, whereas all the boys had already been on screen. That says something about the representation of black women in cinema.\" Toure, 21, was asked to audition as she sat outside a restaurant in Paris's 14th arrondissement. \"At first I thought the casting process was a little strange,\" she admits. \"But there aren't many black actresses in Paris, so they had to do it that way. You know, black teenagers in Paris, boys and girls, don't watch French movies. \"When you watch French films, you don't see many black characters.

Wander through the tight streets and it's hard to see that anything is different - it looks and feels the same as it always has - but a silent revolution is under way. Since 2010, national spending on local government has halved and all of our communities are having to make do with less. In Selby, the police cells and magistrates court have been closed, CCTV and bus services have been cut back, street wardens have been axed and many of the street lights turn off at midnight. And a voluntary army is at work. On the outskirts of the town, Terry Heselton manages a team of volunteers who run Barlby library - which would have closed without their efforts. \"Most people would prefer it if the council could carry on providing the library service, but in the real world that's simply not going to happen,\" he says. Nationally, the number of library volunteers has almost doubled since 2010. It is a new model of civic provision and it brings savings, but Terry says he had doubts. \"Your initial reaction as a group of volunteers is 'we're taking people's jobs, aren't we?' And I'm sure there are some people who still think that, but at the end of the day, I think we now know year-on-year, there's increasing cuts. We're never going to go back to running things the way they used to be.\" North Yorkshire County Council funds many of the services in Selby, but its spending power is shrinking by a third. The council has already saved £116m and it says it has done what it can to protect frontline services, with 60% of the savings found in the back office and more than 100 managers leaving. Gary Fielding has to make the figures work. He says the first cuts were genuine efficiency improvements, but it's got harder. \"You go for the low-hanging fruit, you then grasp for the medium-height fruit and we're now getting the stepladders out and really climbing up that tree,\" he says. \"We will always provide essential services to the most vulnerable, but change has got to happen - even on frontline services.\" Eighty-\n",

By Bridget KendallDiplomatic correspondent, BBC News Usually there is fierce competition to secure one of the 10 rotating seats on the UN Security Council - a chance to sit alongside the five permanent members for two years on the top UN body which rules on international security issues. Instead Saudi Arabia has used the coveted position to lodge a very public protest. This is the second protest from Saudi Arabia. Earlier this month the Saudi foreign minister pulled out of giving a speech at the UN General Assembly, expressing similar frustration. It is a dramatic gesture, but whether it makes immediate reform of the Security Council more likely, as the Saudis demand, is probably questionable. Saudi Arabia has previously expressed frustration at what it sees as an international failure to act on Syria, where it staunchly backs the rebels.

A police officer also visited the ward a few days earlier to speak to Mr Lewis about his bail arrangements, a visit which consultant psychiatrist Dr Olufemi Adebajo told the inquest he was \"extremely unhappy\" about. After the hearing, North Wales Police said the officer had acted \"perfectly reasonably\". Supt Nigel Harrison confirmed Mr Lewis had previous contact with the police and an officer did visit him in hospital to undertake a \"legal requirement\" and \"having sought permission to do so\". He said: \"As part of our multi agency work with our partner agencies, we regularly hold meetings with the local health board, where the now raised concerns by the consultant will be discussed. \"The coroner made it clear that the officer acted perfectly reasonably and we are satisfied that our officers acted entirely appropriately throughout.\" Speaking at the inquest on Friday, the trust's clinical director of mental health, Dr Sandeep Matthews, said they \"could have engaged more with Mrs Lewis, and taken her views on board\". Questioned by the coroner, he agreed that \"on the balance of probability\" the trust had breached their duty of care to Mr Lewis. As well as an apology to the family, the trust said it was making several improvements which included better co-operation with the police, better communication with the families of patients and improvements in documentation.\n",

The piece was found during renovation of the artist's previous home in Whitworth Terrace, Spennymoor, by new owners Joe and Deborah Smith. Auctioneer and art expert John Anderson said it was \"a piece of salvage that may yield a masterpiece\". \"Most artists, if suddenly touched by the muse will grab whatever is available to work out the inspiration,\" he said. The artist, who died last year, started working in the mines when he was 14 and became famous for his paintings of everyday life in the industrial North East after attending the Pitman's Academy. \"In this case, presumably, he looked at it and thought 'there's a painting I'm not satisfied with',\" said Mr Anderson. \"Rather than going to the shop when he was panelling the bathroom cupboard, this was a cheap and convenient expedient.\" Mrs Smith, whose father was Cornish's cousin, said the panel was not signed but \"it is definitely a Cornish because his son-in-law Michael has authenticated it and has written a letter of authentication\". The painting is to be auctioned by Anderson and Garland in September. An early self-portrait of the artist with a hidden portrait of his wife on the other side was sold by the auctioneers for £13,500 in January.\n",

Mr Corbyn is being challenged for the leadership by Owen Smith. The result of the election will be announced on 24 September. The Labour leader, who has said he wants the arts to be a priority for the next Labour government, has received a number of celebrity endorsements in recent weeks. Birmingham-based UB40, named after the then government's unemployment benefit form, were one of the most successful British groups of the 1980s and 1990s, notching up 50 hit singles - among them the chart toppers Red Red Wine, Can't Help Falling in Love and I Got You Babe. Although three members of the original line-up have left in recent years, sparking a legal dispute over the use of the band's name, the remaining members led by guitarist and vocalist Robin Campbell have endorsed Mr Corbyn. \"Jeremy has re-ignited an interest in politics for people who no longer felt included, and engaged and inspired a new generation of young voters who, for the first time, believe that they have an incorruptible politician who truly represents them,\" Mr Campbell said. Drummer Jimmy Brown said Mr Corbyn was the only frontline politician \"willing to speak up for working people who have been badly treated by successive governments, including New Labour, in recent decades\". Mr Corbyn, who is opposed by the majority of his MPs and lost a vote of no confidence after the EU referendum, welcomed the band's backing ahead of a planned joint appearance on Tuesday. \"UB40's story was and remains inspiring; people from across cultures and backgrounds coming together and combining their talents - in a time when prejudice was more prevalent - and creativity to produce music that has endured across decades,\" he said.

More on this and other Hull stories The hearing, chaired by temporary Chief Constable Garry Forsyth, found Underwood's behaviour \"fell far short of the standards of a police officer\". Underwood did not attend the proceedings but accepted the charge. The tribunal heard Underwood had served as an officer for 15 years and was of \"previous good character\".

Convoys of UN trucks on Wednesday began delivering much-needed aid to 80,000 people in five other besieged areas. The UN says 200,000 residents remain besieged in parts of Deir al-Zour. \"It's a complicated operation and would be in many ways the first of its kind,\" Egeland said of the air drops. The UN will work with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and other local groups to drop aid by parachute for distribution, World Food Programme spokeswoman Bettina Luescher said. She did not specify when the air drops would begin but said a single aircraft would be used initially. The World Food Programme had previously ruled out humanitarian air drops in Syria due to the complexities of obtaining use of airspace, organising distribution on the ground, and finding suitable drop zones. The UK government also said air drops were \"high risk and should only be considered as a last resort when all other means have failed\". But Egeland said the strategy was the only way to feed people in Deir al-Zour. \"It is either air drops or nothing. Air drops are a desperate measure in desperate times,\" he told Reuters. Speaking after a meeting of the 17-member International Syria Support Group (ISSG), he also said that UN aid was expected to reach all of Syria's 18 besieged areas within a week. The UN believes more than 480,000 Syrians are living in besieged areas, with four million more people in so-called \"hard-to-reach\" areas. All parties to the conflict are believed to have used siege warfare - where military forces surround an area and cut off essential supplies - in breach of international law. On Wednesday, aid trucks reached rebel-held Muadhamiya and Madaya, near Damascus, and pro-government northern villages of Foah and Kefraya. Another town, Zabadani, was reached later.

The Trust said a child's chances of reaching the top still came down to their schooling and contacts. The government said the state sector was increasingly matching the private sector in terms of academic attainment. Researchers for the Trust, which campaigns for greater social mobility, looked at the educational backgrounds of more than 1,200 people, working in high positions in medicine, the law, the military, journalism, politics, the civil service, business, film and pop music. They also looked at Nobel Prize-winners. The report - Leading People 2016 - found that more than two in five (42%) of British Bafta winners went to a private school, compared with around a fifth (19%) of those who have been awarded a Brit music award. Also, two-thirds (67%) of British Oscar winners were privately educated, among them Eddie Redmayne, who went to Eton, and Kate Winslet, who studied at Redroofs Theatre School. The Sutton Trust suggested the successful state-funded BRIT school in Croydon, which counts Adele and Jessie J among its former pupils, may be one reason why the proportion of state-educated top music stars is higher. The research found that three-quarters (74%) of the UK's top judges went to a fee-paying school, and nearly eight in 10 (78%) went on to Oxford or Cambridge University. Among top military personnel, some seven in 10 (71%) were educated in the private sector, although just 14% were Oxbridge educated. Slightly more than half of leading print journalists and solicitors (51% each) attended fee-paying schools. Just over half (54%) of these journalists attended Oxford or Cambridge, along with 55% of solicitors and 51% of the senior civil servants included in the study. In politics, half the Cabinet were privately educated (including old Etonian Prime Minister David Cameron) compared with 13% of the shadow cabinet, and around a third (32%) of MPs. The current Cabinet does have fewer former independent school pupils than the coalition cabinet of 2010, the report notes, but slightly more than Tony Blair's post-election Cabinet in 2005.

            "Input: summarize: Many larger firms offer to \"match\" additional pension saving by their employees, by adding a contribution when workers save more. But insurer Royal London said that many workers were unaware of the option, and failed to take advantage. This could make a difference of hundreds of pounds in retirement income, it said. Despite having to make a number of assumptions in calculations, Royal London has estimated that an estimated £2bn of employer pension contributions would be available if workers took up the option of saving to a maximum rather than minimum level. It estimated that 3.2 million workers could receive an extra £650 per year each. That would mean somebody on average earnings who chose to take up an additional 3% matched contribution to their pension pot would receive a retirement income of £22,500 rather than £19,050, thanks to the extra contribution and tax relief. The Nationwide Building Society has changed its default level to a maximum, rather than a minimum contribution. Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and now director of policy and Royal London, said more could be done to make workers at other businesses aware that their employer might add to their pension if they were willing to contribute at a higher level. \"At a time when money is tight for many people and pay rises may be limited, getting your employer to contribute more to your pension can be a very cost-effective strategy,\" he said. \"When individuals are thinking about where to put their money to get the best return, the chance to more than double your money through an employer contribution and tax relief from the government takes a lot of beating.\" Graham Vidler, director of external affairs at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, said; \"If your employer offers a workplace pension, you should certainly consider joining and putting in as much as possible as if you don't you will miss out on free money in the form of employer contributions as well as the tax relief. \"This research highlights how much UK employees could be missing out on each year. It is also vitally important that people start saving into a pension as soon as possible as the longer you save, the bigger your final pot is likely to be and the more you can benefit from your employers'matching' contributions.\"\n",

Mr Salmond said the former Conservative Party Prime Minister's \"policies defined a political generation\" for many people in Scotland. \"No doubt there will now be a renewed debate about the impact of that legacy\", he continued. By Brian TaylorPolitical editor, Scotland She never quite got Scotland. However, Margaret Thatcher is not alone among Westminster leaders in that regard. For the most part, she was adored by her party in Scotland, just as in England. But, even as they worshipped, quite a few Scottish Tories fretted that her politics would prove particularly divisive north of the border and thus electorally unpopular. Read more on Brian's blog \"Today, however, the proper reaction should be respect and condolences to her family.\" Ms Davidson praised Lady Thatcher's policies, including extending the right for people to buy their council house. Ruth Davidson said: \"She defended Britain's sovereignty, helped win the cold war, empowered thousands to own their own home by democratising property ownership and smashed the glass ceiling. \"My thoughts are with her family.\" Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: \"I came into politics to fight the ideology and values of Margaret Thatcher which I believe damaged our country.

Their ability to keep track of the squares can be used to screen for vision problems and developers hope it will ease the burden on the NHS. The co-founder of Vision Games, said it was an \"exciting prospect\". Luke Anderson started the company with Dr Stephanie Campbell with support from the Centre of Excellence in Mobile and Emerging Technologies at the University of South Wales. Early tests picked up vision problems, such as lazy eye, in children as young as two. Mr Anderson said: \"We're living in a time where there's increased pressure on the health service and if you can get patients monitoring their own vision at home that takes stress off hospital systems.\" The app, once publically available, would initially flag up any vision problems it identified to the user and advise them if they needed to make an appointment with a GP or optician. In the long-run, Mr Anderson said the data could be synced with family GPs so doctors could access the information to make an assessment. Mr Anderson, a consultant eye surgeon at Cwm Taf University Health Board, said the idea came from the \"extremely difficult\" experience of trying to assess children's eyesight using charts. They often struggled to get young children to sit still, so developing a game children would take an interest in helps them gather more data. Areas of vision tested include colour, motion, black on white and differentiating between shades of grey. The app is about to undergo larger clinical tests after a small initial run, but Mr Anderson said if everything went to plan, it could be downloadable within 18 months. Mr Anderson said getting children to sit still \"was still a problem,\" adding: \"But, looking at my children, the time when they're quiet is when they're sitting there on a tablet or a phone. \"So we just naturally took the science and tried to implement it on that platform.

The shortage involved about six out of the 8,000 parts that go into the Model X but Tesla did not specify which ones. It has raised doubts about how prepared Tesla will be to deliver its new Model 3 car which was announced to much fanfare last week.

Kieran Duffy grabbed Monaghan's third goal as his side bossed the game to book a place in Monday's Round 3B draw. Wexford had three players sent-off in the second half, as well as Kelly. Kelly and Ciaran Lyng were dismissed for two yellow card offences, while Adrian Flynn was flashed a black card four minutes later, with Wexford having used their six substitutes. Substitute John Leacy was shown a straight red card moments later. Monaghan will be joined in Monday morning's qualifier draw by Tipperary, conquerors of Cavan, Carlow, who saw off Leitrim, and Armagh, who saw off Westmeath. The match pitted Wexford manager Seamus McEnaney against his native county, whom he guided to two Ulster finals in 2007 and 2010 during a six-year tenure from 2005 to 2010. In his first season in charge of Wexford, McEnaney saw his side lose to Carlow in the first round of the Leinster SFC, before edging out Limerick by a point in the first round of the qualifiers. Monaghan, who saw off Cavan in Ulster, before losing to Down, made four changes to their starting line-up prior to throw-in, with Dessie Mone, Gavin Doogan, Shane Carey and Dermot Malone replacing Vinny Corey, Darren Hughes, Kieran Duffy and Conor McCarthy. From the outset, the Ulster county appeared determined to ensure that there would be no repeat of their surprise three-point demise to Longford at the same stage of the All-Ireland series last year. Jack McCarron played a part in fashioning both first-half goals, Kelly firing a left-foot strike into the bottom corner in the seventh minute and midfielder O'Connell finding the back of the net in the 26th. A black card for Conor McManus did little to dent Monaghan's superiority as they built up an 11-point\n",

            "Input: summarize: Prof Deaton, 69, is currently professor of economics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, in New Jersey. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said that Prof Deaton's work has transformed several fields of economics. More specifically, the organisation said he had made an impact on economic theory, and on the practical application of data to investigate poverty, and devise economic policy. The headline to the statement from the academy that announced that Prof Deaton was its 2015 winner said: \"Consumption, great and small\". What does this mean? Consumption, to an economist, means spending on goods and services by individuals and households. Understanding it means looking at how consumers allocate spending between different things, how they divide their incomes between spending and saving, and how these patterns vary over time. The \"great and small\" in the academy's headline reflects Prof Deaton's analysis of consumer spending across a whole economy, and at the level of the individual and the household. One theme that runs through the academy's analysis of his work is the extensive use of data on spending taken from household surveys. Previously, economists worked much more from aggregate data for the whole economy. This focus enabled Prof Deaton to produce a theoretical approach that was more consistent with the fluctuations in consumer spending that he found. A more arcane achievement was in developing (with another economist John Muellbauer) a theory of demand for goods and services - how people allocate their spending between different products - that was motivated by problems in earlier analysis. Their system, and subsequent improvements by other researchers, \"has had an immense impact in academia as well as being greatly influential in practical policy evaluation\". Prof Deaton has been an influential figure in development economics. The academy describes him as an important driving force in the transformation of this area of economics - in moving from aggregate data to household surveys. To take one example - his research shed light on the question of whether rising incomes do lead to more calories being consumed, in other words to reducing malnutrition. His work suggests that it does - so encouraging economic growth can help tackle malnutrition. If that were not the case it would be an argument for reorienting policy towards direct food aid.

But an internal review has found \"insufficient controls in place\" to ensure money was not being misused. Payments were spent on utility bills, household repairs, food and parents paying themselves high salaries. Updates on this story and more from Oxfordshire The report added: \"The deputy director has confirmed these example items may not be relevant to meet assessed eligible need.\" The authority's website said direct payments were intended to pay for \"a variety of care and support services\". It said: \"Unless there are exceptional circumstances, you can't use the money to employ a close relative or person living in your home. \"You must not use your direct payment to pay for [...] items such as food, drinks, utilities, gifts or for other everyday items.\" A report to the authority's Audit and Governance Committee said some expenditure had not been approved \"but was not stopped nor recovered\". It added the current system \"does not adequately clarify what is or isn't acceptable\" and \"does not require evidence to support payments\". \"Finance queries had gone unanswered and also questionable expenditure not challenged,\" it said. Labour councillor and committee member John Tanner said he would be pressing for more investigation into direct payments, because they were \"wide open to abuse\". A council spokesman said investigations were continuing into the possible misuse of \"a very small proportion\" of the £25m budget. He said steps would be taken to recover any misspent money and a new direct payment policy was being developed to make it clear how it should be used. Last year, David Cameron wrote to council leader Ian Hudspeth and said he was \"disappointed\" at proposed cuts to Oxfordshire frontline services.

Figures show in the Lothians 15% of children had to wait more than a year. Less than half of the 665 children referred were seen within the target of 18-weeks. Two years ago the Scottish government set a target for Mental Health services that 90% young people should be seen within 18 weeks. The figures for treatment from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) relate to the period between October and December 2016. A spokesperson for the Scottish Children's Services Coalition, a network of support groups, said: \"The figures from NHS Lothian indicating that more than half of those who started their treatment between October and December had been waiting more than the Scottish government target of 18 weeks is clearly disappointing. \"In addition, of the 101 children and young people in Scotland who had been waiting for more than a year before they started treatment, these almost all relate to NHS Lothian. \"We know that half of all diagnosable mental health problems start before the age of 14 and 75% by the age of 21. \"As such it is vitally important that an action plan is put in place for NHS Lothian, radically improving mental health services and increasing investment in these, with an overall aim of ensuring that children and young people get the help they need, when they need it. \"A target of 18-weeks is in itself still far too long. \"Families usually experience months of waiting even before a referral to CAMHS. \"The consequent delay in diagnosis and appropriate support can lead to a crisis situation for the child or young person concerned, as well as for their family, and the need for costly extra resources to address this. \"We hope that NHS Lothian takes account of these figures and takes urgent action to address this matter.\" Alex McMahon, NHS Lothian's executive director of nursing, midwifery and allied health professionals, said: \"More young people than ever before are accessing mental health services and we have seen a steady rise in the number of children and young people being referred to our services. \"Unfortunately patients are having to wait longer than we would like and we are working hard to reduce this number. \"We have invested significantly in CAMHS over the years to support the delivery of expert services for children\n",

Carol Vorderman has also petitioned for him to be knighted. A 237,000-signature petition calling for Mr Johnson to be knighted was taken to No 10 by Carol Vorderman and Gulf War veteran John Nichol in January. It followed a petition by campaigner Paul Walmsley, who also wanted the recognition for the former airman. Bomb-aimer Mr Johnson, from Bristol, joined the newly-formed 617 Squadron in March 1943.

Mr Makarim claims that no other app in Indonesia has reached half a million downloads so quickly. With no money spent on advertising, the success has solely come thanks to positive world of mouth. While motorcycle taxis, known locally as ojek, have long been a popular form of transport in Jakarta, Go-Jek is the first attempt to introduce a hi-tech booking system and guaranteed service standards. Outside of Go-Jek, ojek riders congregate on street corners, and are not officially registered. Payments have to be made in cash, and prices are a matter of negotiation. By contract, Go-Jek recruits and trains its staff, who get uniforms, helmets, and a smart phone on which they manage their pick ups. The company also sets standard fare levels, and provides its drivers with insurance.

But one that technology and social media are making increasingly realisable. \"There was a time when self-publishing was equated with vanity,\" explains John Bond, co-founder of Whitefox, one of several new companies helping 'amateur' authors publish professionally on platforms like Amazon Kindle, Google Play, Apple's iBook Store or Kobo. \"Because of the digital revolution, democratisation has happened. It's almost as if the writer has become his own entrepreneur around the publication process.\" In their competition to get noticed, self-publishers are proving willing to take risks. Andy Weir's The Martian eventually went on to become a Hollywood blockbuster. But the story was originally published chapter by chapter on the author's blog for free. This turned out to be great exposure and it became a huge hit as an audiobook, e-book and physical book. \"There was an adversarial attitude between mainstream publishing houses and self publishers a few years ago,\" says Mr Bond, \"but I think that's changed dramatically.\" He attributes this to traditional publishers' new-found admiration for the self publishers' social media skills, which have helped them find new readers without the benefit of expensive marketing campaigns. Lawyer-turned-author Mark Dawson, for example, uses his website and Facebook page to give out free copies of his thrillers and curates 'Readers' Groups'.

He said rural constituents were being \"fleeced\" with such charges. Halfords said the fee was exceptional for an online exclusive product but that a £2.99 fee would now be charged. Halfords said in a statement: \"When ordering from Halfords.com, normal carriage costs to the Highlands and Islands region apply in over 95% of cases. \"The exception to this was if a customer purchased an online-only exclusive product on Halfords Marketplace which is an online platform that Halfords hosts for smaller independent retailers who deliver direct. \"We agree that the previous charge did not make sense if a Marketplace customer was ordering one item at a small cost and having completed a review, we have reduced the carriage costs to a standard £2.99. \"All suppliers have been notified. Halfords will subsidise the difference whenever the carriage cost is more. We would like to apologise for the frustration this charge has caused for our Marketplace customers.\" Moray SNP MP Angus Robertson had initially written directly to Halfords chief executive Jill McDonald. He said: \"Halfords' decision to quickly review and change their delivery charges policy so that a flat rate now applies regardless of where the customer lives is a very welcome change of heart. \"This action by Halfords demonstrates how important it is to challenge companies large and small on their delivery policies to areas like Moray and the Highlands.\" Welcoming the news, Mr Lochhead said: \"Excessive delivery charges are a massive frustration for people in Moray and across Scotland. \"Halfords decision to now apply the same charge across the board is to be welcomed and I want to see other companies following this example. \"There are many delivery options available to companies, including Royal Mail and there is simply no excuse for companies to discriminate against consumers in Scotland. \"Until companies stop treating customers in rural Scotland with contempt when it comes to delivery charges then we will continue to take a hard line on naming and shaming them.\" A study by the Citizens Advice Bureau in 2015 found consumers in the Highlands and islands were paying substantially more for delivery charges.\n",

Currently, schools must record all racist incidents but there is no legal requirement for them to record other types of bullying. The Welsh Government said it was in the process of reviewing its policy \"to make sure it is as strong as possible\". Bullies Out founder Linda James said: \"We need to have that consistent definition of what exactly bullying is. \"We know that some schools are really proactive with their anti-bullying and they deal with it - but we also hear the stories that others are not. \"I think if there was some consistent reporting and recording procedure for all schools then maybe that would make it a lot easier for the schools in general.\" Earlier this month, the funeral of 14-year-old Nyah James from Swansea was held. Her mother, Dominique Williams claims she took her own life as a result of being bullied at school. She said: \"It makes us feel terrible because we weren't there to stop it. To find out she was being bullied and going through such pain of her own and we didn't know nothing about it - that kills us every day.\" Ms Williams added: \"We feel like we've failed her. I think to myself, did I fail her as a mum because she wasn't able to come and talk to me - thoughts like that go through your head.\" A South Wales Police spokesperson said officers were still investigating the matter. In Northern Ireland, legislation making it a legal requirement for schools to record all reports of bullying was given Royal Assent last year and Bullies Out wants similar legislation in Wales. Rob Williams, director of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, said the call to record all bullying incidents was \"understandable\". But he warned there was a danger that more focus will be put on the recording process and \"not on the effective use of the data\". \"Utilising the information to safeguard children is the key part here, and how this translates into positive action,\" he said.

Nipsa employees are not permitted to become members of the union they work for, but the staff involved are members of another trade union, Unite. Unite representative Kevin Kelly said it was a long-standing dispute and he accused Nipsa's governing general council of a \"failure to practice a standard of industrial relations that they would expect of their officials\". \"My members are disgusted that their employer, who routinely challenges poor industrial relations practice across Northern Ireland, is acting in a manner which no employer would dare,\" Mr Kelly said. \"This dispute is resolvable if the will of the employer existed. \"It is therefore with reluctance and sadness that our members have been forced to take the ultimate action left open to them, that is the withdrawal of their labour\".

Sources, however, say he is Najim Laachraoui, one of the airport bombers. The Belgian prime minister has defended his country's approach to fighting terror threats, insisting Belgium is not a \"failed state\". Charles Michel said everyone in authority had to take a share of the blame for failings before and after 22 March. The attacks by so-called Islamic State on a Brussels airport and metro station killed 32 people. Laachraoui, already a major suspect on the run after the Paris attacks in November, was named as one of the two bombers who targeted Zaventem airport. The EU Parliament said the cleaning firm had provided proof that the person hired had no criminal record at the time. The BBC's James Reynolds in Brussels says the capital's metro and its airport are gradually reopening. Mr Michel said 30 measures were being put place in Belgium, including a ban on pre-paid mobile phone cards. \"Our key message today is we return to normal life in Brussels and in Belgium,\" the Associated Press quoted him as telling reporters. \"When there is an attack like that of course that's a failure and nobody can deny this,\" Prime Minister Michel said. \"[But] I cannot accept the idea that we're a failed state.\" Belgium has been accused of taking an un-co-ordinated approach to terror threats because it has multiple institutions representing the country's complex linguistic and political makeup. The Brussels region alone has six police zones. According to Belgium's De Tijd newspaper, Mr Michel said it was \"short-sighted to say a unified police force could have prevented the attacks\". He said there had been some successes like the recent arrest of the surviving suspect of the Paris attacks last November, Salah Abdeslam, adding it had taken 10 years to track down al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks in the US. The prime minister told our correspondent that giving more capacity to Belgian's security services would be \"crucial for the next months to succeed\". \"This means more equipment but also more capacities for our intelligence services,\" he said. He added that his country's geographical position meant that Belgium was a particular attraction for potential attackers. \"\n",

During his programme on Monday, Conrad said: \"I think women need to be more aware of a man's sexual desire, that when you're in that position that you are about to engage in sexual activity, there's a huge amount of energy in the male body, there's a huge amount of will and intent, and it's very difficult for many men to say no when they are whipped up into a bit of a storm. \"It's the old adage about if you yank a dog's tail then don't be surprised when it bites you.\" He went on to suggest feminists who had \"hijacked\" or \"jumped on\" the argument \"neglect that very important part of the argument\". \"In their fury against men and masculinity they actually forget to stop and say if you tease, if you jump into bed naked with a man, if you give him all the signals and then he acts upon them, then you are partially responsible,\" he said. \"If you don't wish to give out the wrong signals it's best probably to keep your knickers on and not get into bed with him.\" Conrad added he needed to be \"careful\" about what he said because he did not \"want this to be explosive\". \"The onus has to be on the men.... if a woman says no and they persist then that's absolutely abhorrent,\" he said.

One, started on Wednesday, calls on MediaCorp and the government to drop Lambert, on account of his support for gay rights and reputation for risque performances, which it called \"contrary to mainstream Singaporean values\". Comments on the petition called Lambert's performances \"disgusting\", \"disturbing\" and \"lewd\". \"Please give more wholesome role models to our youths,\" said one petitioner Elaine Lui. A counter petition was started on Thursday night and quickly gathered steam, calling on organisers to keep Lambert as a demonstration that Singapore \"shuns discrimination and promotes diverse inclusive points of view\". \"In no way whatsoever does his sexual orientation have any relation to his role as an entertainer and singer. Asking for him to be banned on TV is ludicrous and is akin to asking retailers to stop selling iPhones because [Apple has a] gay CEO,\" said commenter Ivan Lin. As of Friday evening, both petitions were neck-to-neck with thousands of signatures each, drawing in supporters from Malaysia, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan as well. Lambert previously performed in Singapore in 2013 to few complaints, and concerts by other artists such as Lady Gaga have generated greater controversy. The debate over Lambert this time stems from a cultural divide in Singapore that has widened recently. A modern and open city-state with a thriving gay scene and liberal minority, much of its society also remains deeply conservative. A religious right, supported by some Christians and Muslims, has grown in tandem with a burgeoning gay rights movement.

The children's mother said she had accepted compensation from Malaysia Airlines and the government so the boys could move on with their lives. The amount has not been disclosed. The search for the plane, which was carrying 239 people, continues.

He has been awarded the Arctic Star medal for the maritime missions, which Winston Churchill said were the most dangerous of the war. \"I'm very, very grateful to receive this,\" he told the BBC. \"It's only 70 years I suppose, and at last it's happened. Not just because it's a nice thing for me, but because of all those who served with me and they paid the supreme sacrifice. \"Of all the bits that one served during the war, this was the effort that was made by so many. \"I take it [medal] very much in memory of all those who didn't come back, all my shipmates, and that's something that I will very much treasure\". The medal presentation took place at the headquarters of Gloucester-based A Company 6 Rifles. In 2005, an Arctic badge was awarded to the veterans of the convoys but they felt that it did not go far enough. They lobbied the government for a specific medal to recognise the service of those involved in the mission. The Arctic Star medal was created this year. \"This is a medal that we've introduced to honour those people who served on the Arctic convoys in World War II,\" said Conservative MP Mark Francois, the minister of state for defence personnel, welfare and veterans. \"I'm privileged to present this to Canon Brassell.\" The Arctic convoys brought crucial supplies and weapons to Russia, to help fight off Hitler's armies. The icy voyages claimed over 3,000 lives and Winston Churchill described them as the worst journey in the world. The supply ships were under constant threat of attack by German U-boats and aircraft and also had to negotiate severe cold, storms, and ice floes.

The NCA becomes fully operational in 2013 when it takes over from the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Its expanded role will include powers to order police forces to run operations into drugs and trafficking. As well as replacing the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), the new agency will take in the work of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), and also house the national cyber crime unit. It will also cover border policing and economic crime. \"For too long we have lacked a strong, collaborative national response in the fight for criminal justice. The NCA will make the UK a more hostile environment for serious and organised crime and strengthen our border,\" Mrs May said. She said Mr Bristow would play \"a vital role\" in developing the agency. Details of an extensive policing shake-up, which included the creation of the National Crime Agency, were unveiled last year by Mrs May in a Home Office consultation paper - Policing in the 21st Century. She described it as the \"most radical reform of policing for 50 years\". Mr Bristow said he would work with the government and other crime agencies \"to ensure that the NCA delivers the maximum protection possible for communities within the resources it has available\". \"In partnership with other law enforcement agencies, we will ensure that criminals are identified, pursued and brought to justice, their groups dismantled and their activities disrupted. We will do even more to strip away their illegally obtained assets,\" he said. Association of Chief Police Officers president Sir Hugh Orde said Mr Bristow had been chosen from \"a very strong field of police leaders\" to lead the NCA. \"A better co-ordinated response between the international reach and capability of this new agency and the 'eyes and ears' of local neighbourhood policing teams can help keep our streets and communities safer,\" Sir Hugh said.

He had pledged to raise £1m himself for the charity and hit the target three weeks before his death. The trust said £2.7m had been spent refurbishing cancer units at hospitals across the country, with four more - in Cambridge, Hull, Newcastle and the Wirral - now to benefit.

The study - published in the British Journal of Cancer - said that, of those who had previously flagged symptoms to their doctor, 81% had been appropriately referred on by their GP for further treatment or investigation of their symptoms. However it said 19% could be viewed as missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis. The study, funded by the Scottish Chief Scientist's Office, involved a review of the case notes from 1,800 patients diagnosed with cancer in northern Scotland and registered at GP surgeries across NHS Grampian, Orkney and Shetland. Dr Murchie, a GP and researcher at the University of Aberdeen, said: \"This study sheds light on the complications surrounding emergency cancer diagnosis and how quickly circumstances can change for the patient. \"It's vital we do more to ensure people with persistent or unusual symptoms feel confident about getting them checked out by a doctor without delay. \"And it's equally important to give GPs better access to the tests and specialist advice they need to help them spot potential cancer symptoms at the earliest stage.\" Jodie Moffat, Cancer Research UK's head of early diagnosis, said: \"For some patients, emergency presentation may be difficult to avoid, but for others there are often things that could have been done differently. \"Studies like this help us to understand this complex picture and identify what needs to change. \"Cancer patients diagnosed as an emergency are more likely to have late stage disease and poorer survival.

Mr Huntsman received just 17% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary despite campaigning extensively there. He has struggled to build momentum in South Carolina, where the conservative vote is traditionally strong. The Palmetto State goes to the polls on Saturday to pick a candidate for the Republican nomination. The Huntsman campaign had difficulty gaining traction nationally, attracting about 1% to 2% in most opinion polls. As he announced his withdrawal from the race, Mr Huntsman, who pitched himself at his campaign launch as a \"civil\" candidate who would not play dirty, bemoaned the state of the Republican contest. By Mark MardellBBC North America editor Read Mark's thoughts in full Profile: Jon Huntsman \"This race has degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks,\" he said, calling on the Republican party to unite behind a single candidate. \"Divisiveness is corrosive,\" he added, saying that the \"the current toxic form of our political discourse does not help our cause\". Mr Huntsman, 51, is a fluent Mandarin speaker and served as US President Barack Obama's first ambassador to China. In the early 1990s he became the youngest head of a US diplomatic mission for a century when he was appointed ambassador in Singapore. Mr Huntsman's withdrawal from the race came the morning after he received an endorsement from The State, the largest newspaper in South Carolina. They called Mr Huntsman and Mr Romney the \"two sensible, experienced grown-ups in the race'', but said the former ambassador was \"more principled\" and offered \"a significantly more important message''.

Spain were out to avenge their defeat by the Azzurri in the last 16 of Euro 2016 and quickly took control of the match. They went close when Andres Iniesta played a one-two with David Silva only to see a weakly struck left-footed shot saved before Gerard Pique sent a close-range header straight at Buffon. Spain looked set for victory after 38-year-old Buffon's error as he completely missed the ball when trying to clear a through ball to Vitolo. However, substitute Ciro Immobile brought some much-needed energy and threat to the home attack and a rash Ramos challenge allowed De Rossi to score.

The signatories include swimmer Rebecca Adlington, 400m hurdler Sally Gunnell, long jumper Lynn Davies and 11-time Paralympic gold medallist Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson. The letter, which was organised by the newspaper, has been sent to the IOC's executive board, which will make the decision on whether to have a blanket ban on Russia's participation. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has already excluded Russia's track and field team from the Games. Pengilly, a member of the IOC's Athletes' Commission and one of four British IOC members, conceded: \"I say reluctantly [that Russia should be banned] because there are very probably clean Russian athletes, and they will suffer, and this is nothing short of terrible. \"It's an incredibly tough decision. There's no fair outcome for everyone.\" But he insisted: \"The Russian flag should not be flown at the Rio Olympic Games.\" In 2013 Pengilly received praise for raising the issue of doping before the vote to decide a host of the 2020 Games, questioning both Spain and Turkey during their bid presentations in Buenos Aires. Russia could face a blanket ban after a damning report compiled by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren claimed it operated a state-sponsored doping programme from 2011 to 2015. The IOC is exploring \"legal options\" before deciding whether to implement \"a collective ban\" on all Russian competitors for the global showpiece, which starts on 5 August. A decision by its executive board could come on Sunday. \"Clean athletes, the Olympic Games and the wider Olympic movement have been mocked,\" Pengilly said. \"However, Russia is an important sporting nation\n",

A deep sea search vessel had also sent back the first images of the wreckage, the statement added. There were 66 people on board flight MS804 when it crashed on 19 May while flying from Paris to Cairo. The Airbus A320 plane vanished from Greek and Egyptian radar screens, apparently without having sent a distress call. The Egyptian investigation committee said that investigators on board the John Lethbridge search vessel, which has been contracted by the Egyptian government, would now draw up a map of the wreckage distribution. What do we know so far? Who were the victims? Earlier this month, search teams said signals from one of the \"black box\" flight recorders had been detected. Signals emitted by the recorders are expected to expire by 24 June, experts have warned. The cause of the crash remains a mystery. A terror attack has not been ruled out but no extremist group has claimed the downing of the plane. Analysts say human or technical error is also a possibility. Flight data revealed that smoke detectors went off in the toilet and the aircraft's electrics, minutes before the plane's signal was lost. According to Greek investigators, the plane turned 90 degrees left and then 360 degrees to the right, dropping from 11,300m (37,000ft) to 4,600m (15,000ft) and then 3,000m (10,000ft) before it was lost from radar.\n",

An election is due to be held next year after four years of coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD). Mrs Merkel's poll ratings have slipped since the height of her popularity but she retains wide support. The chancellor, who has been in office since 2005, is also being challenged by the populist right-wing AfD party. She announced she would stand again after meeting party leaders at CDU headquarters. She told reporters that the decision to run for a fourth term had been \"anything but trivial after 11 years in office\". She added that she expected challenges from both the right and the left of the political spectrum. Is Merkel really on the ropes? Profile: Angela Merkel In September, Mrs Merkel accepted responsibility for election defeats for the CDU in several states and conceded that her open-door policy towards migrants was a factor. Germany expected up to 300,000 migrants to arrive in the country this year, the head of the country's federal office for migration and refugees said earlier this year. In 2015, Germany received more than a million applications for asylum. She's kept Germany guessing for weeks, but it looks as though Angela Merkel has finally answered the so called K-frage (chancellor question). A poll for one Sunday newspaper (in German) found that 55% of Germans would vote for her. Mrs Merkel's approval ratings have gone up and down in recent months as a result of her refugee policy but they remain the envy of other world leaders. Even so, she will be battling the tide of populism that swept Donald Trump to victory in the States and which is also washing across Europe. The anti-Muslim party Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD) is likely to win seats in the national parliament next year. It's highly unlikely to take Mrs Merkel down but it is leaching votes from Germany's established political parties. Those parties are - by and large - likely to be relieved by Mrs Merkel's decision. In the past few years the job of German chancellor has become one of the most powerful political positions in the world. The next incumbent must not only lead the country but deal with a fragmenting EU, in a world which may be much changed\n",

More on this and other North Yorkshire stories In its report, the IPCC said an ambulance had gone to the park after a member of the public had contacted them to say he had pulled a man out out of the lake. A paramedic searched the park for about 38 minutes but could not find the missing man, so he called the police. PC Hardie attended the scene at about 04:00 GMT. The IPCC report said: \"A four-minute search was carried out before PC Hardie left the area, she did not seek assistance and the incident log was closed soon after.\" It added that the officer concluded the missing man had fled the scene \"despite a paramedic's view that he would be incapable of such action because of freezing temperatures\". She later told an inspector \"there was no evidence a man had been pulled from the lake\". Mr Egan's body was found at about 11:30 GMT. The IPCC investigator said that in his opinion \"PC Hardie had a case to answer for gross misconduct\".

Mr Clarke, 58, was unconscious when the lorry veered out of control on 22 December 2014, killing six people. The inquiry found he had \"repeatedly lied in order to gain and retain jobs\". Relatives of Erin McQuade and Jack and Lorraine Sweeney made the announcement about the private prosecution after a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into the crash published its findings. In their statement, they criticised a decision by the Crown Office not to prosecute Mr Clarke and said they had instructed their own lawyers to take action. The family said: \"The family note the press release by the Crown and they contend they were right not to prosecute the driver. \"We firmly remain of the view that they are wrong as is their interpretation of the findings and recommendations. \"As a result we have instructed our solicitor to commence a prosecution against the driver.\" The family's statement came after the Crown Office said: \"There are no findings in the determination that undermine the decisions not to prosecute the driver. \"There was no finding that the driver knew or ought to have known that he was unfit to drive.\" The statement concluded: \"We note the sheriff's findings on the driver's motivation to retain or gain employment. \"It is important to note the sheriff was considering evidence at an FAI where a lesser standard of proof is required and where more relaxed rules of evidence apply. \"A criminal prosecution requires sufficient evidence to the much higher standard beyond reasonable doubt.\" The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) at Glasgow Sheriff Court, before Sheriff John Beckett, was set up after the Crown Office decided not to prosecute anyone over the crash. The inquiry, which concluded in August, examined the circumstances of the tragedy. Sheriff Beckett's determination is critical in particular of driver Harry Clarke, stating outright that the crash might have been avoided had he not lied about his medical history.

I said it had all the weird fascination of one of those Victorian Odditoriums with Wang the Human Unicorn and Ella the infamous Camel Girl. The appeal of an Old Firm derby is not so much the football but the grisliness surrounding the football. That's the marketability of this game - the rot. It's not known as one of the most storied derbies in world football because of the quality of the action on the field. Maybe it was back in the day - undoubtedly it was - but that hasn't been the case for a long time now. Those who get drawn to it do so because of its essential madness, its toxicity, its poison. That's an uncomfortable admission given the nature of some of the things that go on around this match - the bigotry, the violence, the viciousness and hysteria on social media. But it's the truth. At its craziest, it's football's equivalent of the Jim Rose Circus. And, love it or loathe it, for the next three months, there will be little escape from it. It's back - or soon will be. It was inevitable. Plenty have missed it. Plenty of others have not. It is possible to celebrate its return while also having an acute dread. That might seem like a contradiction, but in the strange world of the Old Firm, it makes some kind of sense. By the time it comes around, it will have been almost three years since the previous meeting of these two clubs. Expect that to be reflected in the acreage of newsprint and radio hours that will be expended on this Scottish League Cup semi-final. Before a previous meeting, I spent the week counting the number of newspaper pages given over to the fixture, from the Monday before to the Monday after. I gave up halfway through when the count had soared to over 100. One title had 27 pages dedicated to the game on one day alone. After a gap of three years, the mind boggles as to what lays ahead in terms of countdown. If you stop your stopwatch at the point when it was obvious that they would be drawn together, it probably it took a fraction of a millisecond for the first tweet\n",

Following an appeal by British Transport Police (BTP), she came forward voluntarily, officers said. At the time of the incident, rail bosses described it as \"one of the closest near misses we've seen\". BTP released the CCTV of the Cambridge woman passing the closed barrier and ignoring warning signals and lights. Hundreds of thousands of people watched the footage of her cycling up to the tracks before slamming on her brakes, and edging backwards as the train sped past. Moments later the woman was seen mopping her brow before cycling off in the direction she had come from. Her actions forced the driver of the train to apply the emergency brake when he saw her, operator Greater Anglia said. More than 100 trains travel through the Waterbeach crossing each day, at speeds of up to 75mph (120km/h). Since 1 January, there have been 70 reported incidents at level crossings in Cambridgeshire, a BTP spokesman said. However, incidents such as this one were \"extremely rare\", he added.

Police told local media the militants detonated a grenade after failing to escape and to avoid being captured. The dead are believed to include members of a local jihadist group. On Saturday six people - two police officers and four civilians - were killed in twin bombings in Sylhet when commandos flushed out another group of suspected Islamist militants. So-called Islamic State (IS) claimed on messaging app Telegram that it was behind one of the blasts. In the latest incident on Thursday, police told The Daily Star that the bodies were discovered when a bomb disposal team entered the militants' den after \"disposing of grenades and bombs [which were] lying scattered on the floor\" of the building. The paper says that the sound of gunfire and explosions could be constantly heard right up until the time the security forces entered the premises. It is unclear how a child was apparently caught up in the violence. The BBC's Waliur Rahman in Dhaka says that another suspected hideout in the same north-eastern area has also been surrounded by police since Wednesday. Meanwhile, law enforcers are also keeping a close watch on a building in the eastern town of Comilla, where a similar raid to flush out militants is imminently expected. The escalation in violence comes at a time when many in Bangladesh thought security forces had managed to curb Islamist militancy, following the deadly siege on a cafe in Dhaka last year. Recent suicide attacks on security camps and checkpoints have surprised many. IS has claimed to be behind at least two other incidents this month, including one at a checkpoint near Bangladesh's international airport and one involving a man who tried to cross a checkpoint run by an elite police unit.

Ruby is now building a successful career in art and has landed a publishing deal. At 17 she left education and began to draw every day.

The details of the state of emergency remain unclear, but she adds that protesters have already shown they will not back down when faced with force. Many roads into and out of the capital, Addis Ababa, are blocked by protesters. The protests since last November are for manifold reason, and include: In the most recent unrest in Oromia, at least 55 people were killed in a stampede. Opposition activists blame the police for causing panic at the annual Ireecha celebrations - a traditional Oromo religious festival. The government blames \"anti-peace forces\" demonstrating in the crowd. Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters angered at their handling of the event, witnesses told the BBC. Protesters say violence by the security forces led to the stampede, but the PM denied security forces had opened fire. Correspondents say that while the ruling coalition has some solid achievements to show for its 25 years in power, it has been unable to manage the transition from being a secretive revolutionary movement to running an open, democratic government.\n",

He had previously been manager of both Scunthorpe United and Brighton. During his playing career, he was a wing-half for Matt Busby's United, then Leeds before finishing at Scunthorpe. As one of the Busby Babes, he made his first team breakthrough at Old Trafford following the Munich Air Disaster in 1958. He played in the first game after Munich, just a fortnight later, when the team-sheet in the programme was famously left blank for the club's FA Cup fifth-round win over Sheffield Wednesday. And he was in the rebuilt United team all the way to Wembley, where they lost 2-0 to local rivals Bolton Wanderers. Heywood-born Goodwin also played first-class cricket over two summers, making 11 appearances as a fast bowler for his native Lancashire, in which he took a career-best 5-35 against Middlesex at Lord's in June 1955. After leaving Birmingham in 1975, Goodwin took up an offer to move to the then burgeoning North American Soccer League, where he had two spells as coach, then club president of the Minnesota Kicks. He remained in the United States for the rest of his life, and died at home in Gig Harbor, Washington State at the weekend.

Qualcomm is best known for making processors that power smartphones. However, one analyst suggested the device was too bulky to appeal beyond a niche enthusiast audience. The $349 (£215) gadget is being made available via only Qualcomm's website to US customers, and the company said it was \"unlikely\" it would sell the watch elsewhere. The Toq is designed to be paired with any smartphone running Android 4.0.3 or higher. It allows its owner to receive and send text messages, manage reminders and view other information - such as weather forecasts or stock prices - obtained via their handset. There is no software store for the watch itself, but existing handset apps can be adapted to send details to its display and activate a vibrate function. In addition it can be used to accept or reject calls, and control what music is being played from the linked phone's library. The company says that the watch's key innovation is its use of its proprietary Mirasol technology. Rob Chandok, president of Qualcomm Interactive Platforms, described this as being similar to the e-ink displays commonly used by e-book readers and another smartwatch - the Pebble - but better. \"In addition to the fact it offers colour, the refresh rate of Mirasol can be 30 frames a second, which allows you to build a touch interface,\" he told the BBC. \"That's tremendously important when you are trying to offer some of these experiences. \"In an e-ink display you can't refresh the screen fast enough to follow the finger.\" Mirasol is significantly less power-hungry than the OLED tech used by Samsung's Galaxy Gear watch, meaning that unlike its rival, its screen does not have to turn itself off when angled away from the user's face to extend battery life. Sony's Smartwatch 2 does offer an always-on LCD display - however, it requires the user to switch on a backlight in dim conditions. Although Qualcomm suggests the Toq's lack of an on/off switch makes it the superior option, Mr Chandok acknowledged that the Toq display's graphics were not as vibrant or crisp as the alternatives. \"But we've got other versions of Mirasol in the pipeline that are going\n",

Ms Chapman was among 10 Russians arrested in the US who admitted to being agents for a foreign country. Last week her lawyer said she would like to come to the UK as she has a UK passport through a previous marriage. Russia agreed to exchange four US spies for the 10 Russian agents and the swap was carried out in Vienna on 9 July. Ms Chapman, who is also known as Anya Kushchenko, is the daughter of a Russian diplomat. Until the Home Office's decision, she had dual Russian-UK nationality. BBC home affairs correspondent Andy Tighe said Ms Chapman became the best-known of the Russian spy ring after details and photographs from her Facebook entry were picked up by newspapers around the world. He said her lawyers were handed a letter formally revoking her citizenship and she was told her passport was no longer valid. It is understood steps are also being taken to permanently exclude Ms Chapman from travelling to the UK in the future, our correspondent said. Earlier this month, Briton Alex Chapman, 30, from Bournemouth, Dorset, talked to a newspaper about his four-year marriage to the 28-year-old Russian. He said they had met at a party in London in 2002 and married five months later. He said she changed dramatically during the marriage, and by the end was having \"secretive\" meetings with \"Russian friends\". Ms Chapman did not seek to conceal her Russian identity when she arrived in New York from Moscow in February 2010, saying she wanted to build up a recruitment agency targeting young professionals in both cities.

It said there had been \"blatant\" collective failures by the council's leadership, a failure by South Yorkshire Police to prioritise the issue and said senior managers had \"underplayed\" the scale of the problem.

But, 12 months on, BBC News asked those most closely involved what has changed in Rotherham? Jessica, not her real name, said she was first abused when she aged just 12. Since the report was published, she believes there has been \"real change\" in the way the authorities deal with victims of child sexual exploitation (CSE). \"We're now being listened to, there's more support in place and survivors and their families are now on board and helping agencies shape services,\" she said. \"We're telling them what we need and what's going to help us move forward.\" However, she said more needed to be done and called for \"mandatory education\" for children on the dangers of grooming and increased funding for police forces. \"I know a lot of people find it difficult to trust the authorities but I do think things are really changing now,\" she continued. \"I think the way people look at abuse is changing and I think the authorities recognise that it's not the victim's fault, it's not the parents' fault and that the perpetrators are the ones to blame.\" In a video message posted on Rotherham Council's website, council leader Chris Read said: \"We've begun to make the changes that we need and we are making progress.

But - of course - that may all turn out to be a naively rosy expectation when the results are finally in. The votes have yet to be counted, after all, and it's possible the Labour Party may end up wishing the outcome was merely painful and no worse. It could just conceivably turn out to be catastrophic. If this all sounds a little apocalyptic, forgive me. Hair-rending and teeth gnashing Doom-laden adjectives are the stock in trade of political punditry at election time, especially when the occasion lends itself to a little hair-rending and teeth-gnashing. And there is already a not-especially-orderly queue of Jeremy Corbyn's critics in the Labour Party, waiting to blame poor results for their party on his leadership, and clearing their throats to strike up the chorus of voices wanting him to go. In so far as an objective analysis exists, what would a bad night for Labour look like? No main opposition party has suffered net losses of council seats for 30 years. The English local council seats up for grabs were won at the height of Labour's popularity under Ed Miliband - though that's not saying a great deal. Now, losses look inevitable, and a pantheon of psephologists predict 150, 190, more? Mr Corbyn's Labour enemies have set the bar for respectability impossibly high. Four hundred gains are the minimum to show progress, according to the likes of defeated leadership contender Liz Kendall, and given the fact Labour's trailing the Conservatives in the national polls, she might as well have demanded 400,000. If Labour comes third in Scotland - though that's not thought very likely - or loses in London - something almost no-one expects to happen, the hair-rending and teeth-gnashing will be so frenzied as to leave the entire Labour Party, Corbynistas and anti-Corbynistas alike, bald and toothless.

Three of them have not been found and are presumed dead. Since the avalanche, more than 300 international climbers have abandoned their plans to scale Mount Everest - the world's highest mountain at 8,848m (29,029ft), which straddles the border between China and Nepal. Nepal's tourism and mountaineering authorities have been left high and dry. Anita Lama, 23, is the widow of Asman Tamang, 26, who also died on the mountain. \"I never thought that such a tragedy would happen,\" she told the BBC, her eyes welling up as she carried her daughter, 11-month-old Dolma Tamang. \"He started going to the mountains for work for the past four years or so. \"Before the accident he said he would come back after two months.

The Police Federation says it is \"disappointed\" by the announcement. What are the key changes? The recommendations of the mammoth two-part Winsor Review of police pay had one simple aim: to stop paying police officers for the time they have served and start paying them for their skills and the challenges they face. In other words - the days of paying an officer more just because he had done 28 years would go. The first part of the review said police were being paid under a system that had been devised for a world that no longer existed. Forces have shifted resources increasingly into specialised units. That's because (broadly speaking) expert teams - be they officers working on burglary intelligence or those who deal with child abuse - should be able to amass the knowledge needed to solve more crimes more quickly. Winsor said that reforming pay and conditions would help chiefs to focus resources where they were needed, while preventing some officers from seeking out the easiest of posts. The second part of the review called for chiefs to be able to make officers redundant - a fundamental shift in the employment protection enjoyed by sworn officers. it also called for physical fitness tests and direct entry into senior ranks for recruits with relevant outside experience - be it military or business management skills. He also wanted accelerated promotion to inspector for the best recruits, to encourage more top graduates into policing. Police pay is set through a national negotiating board - and disputes go to a arbitration tribunal. There were a number of sticking points during the negotiations: The government said that pay needed to be based on skills and how they were used, rather than number of years served. It said forces needed this flexibility because of the different challenges each area of the country faced. Although forces were broadly on track to make spending cuts of up to 20% by March 2015, that was not guaranteed. Starting salaries will be cut by up to £4,259 from April, making the starting salary £19,000. This salary will be given to those with the least or no relevant experience - such as those who join at 18. But some recruits will start on £22,000 if they have some experience, such as time spent as a special constable. The change in starting salaries will\n",

But columnists raised the issue of her failure to tackle Mr Trump effectively, allowing him to \"exceed expectations\". \"The smiling Hillary we saw throughout the first debate on Long Island? She didn't make the trip west.\" Fox News concludes that Mr Trump managed to pull off a surprising performance, although the news channel does not explicitly state that the Republican candidate won the debate. The conservative network says he performed well, pivoting and manoeuvring through questions, allowing him to save his presidential hopes. Political analyst William Whelan said the night fell into the hands of Mr Trump. He said the Republican defended his record and unlike the first debate, when he was often blown off course by the former secretary of state and \"torpedoed by his own badgering performance\", he improved as the night went on. Mr Trump's decision to launch a blistering attack against Hillary Clinton and her husband is described by Fox as the equivalent of \"Hillary dropping Alicia Machado on Trump\" in the previous debate. That was the line used by Breitbart news, which is in a minority in handing the title to Mr Trump. In a leading story quoting comments from former mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, it reports that Mrs Clinton was \"pounded on bad decisions\". It refers to accusations from Mr Trump that Mrs Clinton and the Democratic Party helped \"create the vacuum in the Middle East\" that allowed so-called Islamic State to form.

CCTV showed the 31-year-old threatening staff with the axe before shopkeeper Sab Dhillon tackled him to the floor and restrained him. Durham Crown Court heard McKerry, of Coundon, near Bishop Auckland, had earlier admitted attempted robbery. McKerry, whose face was hidden by a scarf and hood, brandished the weapon as he ordered shop assistant Andrea Brighty to fill a bag with money from the till, the court heard. But Mr Dhillon ran from a back office, grabbed McKerry from behind and wrestled him to the floor. The court heard McKerry, dubbed Boomerang Boy because of his repeated spells in prison, had been arrested more than 80 times. He was told he must serve an extended four-year licence period after he is released. The court was told McKerry started shoplifting at the age of 12 and by 15 he had been arrested 80 times, and had convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. McKerry once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. Dramatic CCTV footage from the shop showed the masked McKerry waving an axe as he demanded cash from terrified assistant Andrea Brighty. But he did not see Mr Dhillon's rugby tackle, which dropped him to the floor, sending shelves and produce tumbling.

The Somali Islamist militant al-Shabab group has been targeting Kenya over the deployment of Kenyan forces to Somalia. Most of the victims were youths including returnees from Somalia who had surrendered after the government promised them amnesty, Haki Africa's report said. Others were allegedly killed as a result of excessive use of force during police crackdowns on protests and other religious groups that had been accused of radicalising young people. Saada Suleiman, who attended the report's launch in the capital, Nairobi, said her husband had been missing for two years since his arrest in a raid on Masjid Musa mosque in Mombasa known for its radical sermons.

But what about the French, with their centuries of scholarship and ancient institutions? There was a university in Paris before Oxford or Cambridge. French universities are conspicuous by their absence. In the most recent QS World University Rankings there were none in the top 20 and only two in the top 100. That could all change from next year. As part of a huge government-driven academic and economic project, there will be a new university called Paris-Saclay, with a campus south of the French capital. The project has initial funding of 7.5bn euros (£5.9bn) for an endowment, buildings and transport links. The French government is bringing together 19 institutions into a single structure, with the aim of building a university big enough to compete with global giants like Harvard or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Dominique Vernay, the president of this new university, says that within a decade he wants Paris-Saclay to be among the top ranking world universities. \"My goal is to be a top 10 institution,\" he says. In Europe, he wants Paris-Saclay to be in the \"top two or three\". In university rankings, big is beautiful, and the Paris-Saclay will have 70,000 students and 10,000 researchers.

The most disadvantaged pupils in Shanghai match the maths test results of wealthy pupils in the UK. Mr Schleicher says it \"debunks the myth that poverty is destiny\". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove said individual schools in England should take Pisa tests, so that they could compare themselves against international standards. The latest Pisa - Programme for International Student Assessment - test results were published last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranking developed countries in terms of how well 15-year-olds performed in tests in reading, maths and science. Source: OECD This showed the UK as a middle-ranking country, with Asian school systems, such as in Singapore, South Korea and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, as the highest performers. But Mr Schleicher's latest analysis compares the performance of the most deprived 10% of pupils. This reveals how the poorest in many countries overlap with the results of the wealthy in other countries. The poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers taking the test in the UK and the United States. In Europe, the Netherlands has the highest-performing pupils from the poorest families. Poor pupils in the Netherlands are as good at maths as much better-off teenagers in France. The poorest 10% of pupils in Hong Kong scored at a higher level than the wealthiest in Sweden and Norway. The very lowest performers among this group were in the Slovak Republic. Mr Schleicher says it shows how academic differences attributed to social background should not be unquestioningly tolerated. \"We tend to overestimate the impact of poverty,\" he says. There was also a challenge to the idea that the UK has an unusually poor record on social mobility. Dr John Jerrim at the Institute of Education published a study suggesting that in international terms the UK was mid-ranking in the link between family background and future employment opportunities - 17th out of 34 developed countries.

The last of those was an eight-run defeat by West Indies, their first win over Australia and the result that sealed their place in a maiden final. Because of that victory, Windies skipper Aguilleira said her side had a \"psychological advantage\" over the team that had lifted the trophy on five previous occasions. But Australia were too clinical for a West Indies side that were sloppy in the field, wayward with the ball and unable to keep up with the run chase. In reclaiming the trophy they last won in 2005, Australia add to the World Twenty20 they won in October and the Ashes they will try to defend in England in August. It is the first time they have held all three of women's cricket's major titles simultaneously. Only once in the match were they under pressure, as four wickets fell for 28 runs around the batting powerplay. \"If an emerging sport needs a star to help raise its profile, then women's cricket has struck gold with Ellyse Perry. An international in both cricket and football, the 22-year-old also somehow manages to find time to present shows on radio and television as well as studying for an economics and social sciences degree.\" Read the rest of our feature Before that, Haynes, who added 52 for the first wicket with Meg Lanning, shared a second-wicket stand of 64 with Cameron.

They will only apply to yellow cards shown for dissent, and will see players leave the field for 10 minutes. It will also be tested in Sunday League and male and female youth football. More than 1,000 clubs received emails over the weekend asking if they were willing to be part of the pilot process. \"There has already been a positive response with over 60 leagues in support of it,\" an FA spokesperson said. Clubs are normally charged a £10 fine for each yellow card but the FA will not be charging this administration fee for those that participate. Step seven is the bottom level of English football's National League System, which feeds into the country's professional leagues. The highest league within that structure - step one - is the National League. The move has been backed by teenage Sunday League referee Ryan Hampson, who earlier this year organised a nationwide strike by officials in protest at the amount of abuse they face in the grassroots game. \"There's obviously a lot more to be done but it's a step in the right direction and a great start,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live.\n",

The band had previously worked with the British Film Institute in sourcing archive recordings to sample, and they turned to BFI again in their hunt for material from the Cold War space race. \"At the time I called them up to ask them if they had any space footage they'd only just inherited it from another collection,\" said J Willgoose. \"One of my biggest concerns about writing this album was about finding the material for the Soviet missions. \"It was an incredible stroke of luck that the BFI happened to come across these films just as I started asking after them.\" A fan of space exploration, Willgoose was familiar with the battles between the USA and USSR to beat one another to historic firsts. The Soviets got the first satellite into space in the 1950s and the first man in the 1960s, while the Nasa's Apollo missions put the first men on the Moon. But Willgoose was still surprised by what was in the BFI's newly-acquired collection. He said: \"Most of the Soviet stuff was new to me - even now it's hard to find a great deal of good quality literature or footage of their missions because their space programme was shrouded in such secrecy. \"A good deal of the material from the Apollo missions I hadn't heard before - I really went very deep into the mission logs and dug out stuff that I hadn't heard of before. \"The public relations feed for the Apollo 8 lunar orbit was one of my favourite pieces of audio for the whole album.\" One of the tracks on the new album - The Race for Space - is dedicated to cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. However, in a strange twist the music ended up evoking an American theme. Willgoose said: \"I'd had this guitar riff lying around for a couple of years as I'd tried to use it on another song and it hadn't worked, and it was always at the back of my mind because I really liked it. \"Then when it came to matching up musical ideas that I'd had with likely topics for the album, and\n",

Figures from the NI Cancer Registry reveal there is a higher diagnosis rate among young people in Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK. Five charities have come together to provide a new service that includes five new nursing posts, one in each health trust. There are also social workers and community workers to guide young people at home, school and work. The service aims to ensure young people have equal clinical and psychological support for their medical and social needs no matter where they live. Figures also reveal that the amount of miles that local families, seeking support, clock up is the second highest compared to their counterparts elsewhere. Up until now, the service has been confined to the Belfast Cancer Centre and The Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children. Bridging that gap means the service will now be available in four hospitals including Belfast, Craigavon, Altnagelvin, Ulster and Antrim Area. That means fewer families will have to make the average 100 mile round trip to get treatment in Belfast. Leona McManus, 22, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year. \"Travelling while undergoing treatment is hard. You are tired, sick, often in pain. I had to travel from Limavady to Belfast. \"This new service means I can go to Altnagelvin - young people will also have a nurse, even a community worker.

He dispatched a penalty for his treble by the 30th minute and United could have had several more by half-time. Sean Welsh's penalty gave Thistle hope but United saw out the win comfortably. The hosts were sluggish in the first half of their Championship opener against Queen of the South on Saturday but there was nothing to fault the way they started this tie. United had too much pace and ingenuity for their top-flight opponents, the outstanding Scott Fraser and Tope Obadeyi causing havoc with their movement. Obadeyi, twice, and Blair Spittal might have added further goals by the interval but United boss Ray McKinnon manager must have been happy with the three they did score. Smith showed the benefit of a regular start on loan, taking his goal tally to four for the Terrors, the same number he scored in nearly 90 appearances for Aberdeen, though a high percentage of those outings were as a substitute. His first was a sublime finish, gathering a delicious Fraser pass, controlling the ball then steering it behind Ryan Scully. For his second, Smith picked up possession just inside the Thistle half, run away from Callum Booth then held off the defender to score when he got back to him in the box. The 20-year-old completed his hat trick with a penalty struck straight down the middle after Ziggy Gordon blocked Blair Spittal's shot with an arm. Thistle were given a glimpse of a way back from a penalty of their own when Chris Erskine was pushed over by Mark Durnan and Welsh scored with 25 minutes left, but United's defence held firm. United boss Ray McKinnon: \"We played some very good football in the first half, especially the forward play, and when the penalty was given against us in the second, I was really pleased with how we reacted. We showed some resilience. \"Some of the link-up play and finishing was pretty special. Cammy's composure and movement for the goals was outstanding, he has done really well since coming in on loan.

It comes after controversy surrounding the conduct of undercover officers. Meanwhile, a separate review into the relationship between the Home Office and the SDS says a key file is missing. The inquiry announced on Thursday will also make recommendations about how undercover policing is conducted and will scrutinise the use of undercover officers by the now-defunct SDS and National Public Order Intelligence Unit. Among the allegations are that undercover officers took fake identities from dead children, had relationships with campaigners and fathered children. Mrs May said that the work of barrister Mark Ellison and Operation Herne - an investigation into undercover policing at the Metropolitan Police - has unearthed \"serious historical failings\" in undercover policing practices. Mr Ellison - who in 2012 successfully prosecuted Gary Dobson and David Norris for the murder of teenager Stephen Lawrence - has been examining police corruption during the original investigation into the killing in 1993. She added: \"As I said last year, I was profoundly shocked by Mark Ellison's findings and committed to establishing a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the SDS. \"While I initially said that Mark Ellison's further work and criminal investigations needed to conclude before the inquiry commences, it has become apparent that these pieces of work were much larger than initially envisaged. \"In the interest of learning the lessons of past failures, I have decided to establish the inquiry now while ensuring existing work is not affected. \"Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future.\" This latest inquiry will be led by judge Lord Justice Pitchford. Mrs May had announced her intention to set up a judge-led public inquiry following the report of the independent Ellison Inquiry in March last year.

Mendes made his name in theatre, and directed a new stage production of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in between making the Bond films. But shooting a Bond movie is \"pretty much all encompassing\", he explained. \"I'm happiest rehearsing a play or editing a movie, and when I've finished editing a movie I generally want to be back in a theatre environment again,\" he said. \"It feels like home, it feels controllable after the chaos of a movie set.

            "Input: summarize: A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth. The proposal to allow abortion in such cases was defeated by 59 votes to 40. The result followed a passionate debate at Stormont after some MLAs proposed the law change be introduced by way of an amendment to the Justice Bill. Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Politicians have been lobbied to reform the law since 2013, when Northern Ireland woman Sarah Ewart spoke out about having to travel to Great Britain for an abortion after she was told she was carrying a baby that had no chance of survival. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) faced criticism from other parties during Wednesday's debate for asking the Health Minister Simon Hamilton to set up a working group to examine the issues raised by fatal foetal abnormality. It could take six months for the group to complete its work and the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt claimed it was a DUP \"device\" to delay decision making on abortion reform until after May's assembly election. Justice Minister David Ford, who brought forward the proposed change to the legislation, told Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show it could now remain in limbo for some time. \"It would appear that that is what some people want, that it was any excuse at all to avoid taking a decision last night so they can fudge the issue,\" he said. \"We will wait and see what happens to the DUP's supposed working group for the next six months. Certainly, we'll get the DUP past the election, maybe that's why they're doing it.\" However, the DUP has argued that the issue required proper consideration by MLAs and ministers and that the Justice Bill was not intended for this purpose. The amendment to legalise abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality was proposed by Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson. He told MLAs: \"If we are to continue to fail women in Northern Ireland in this area then we are abdicating our duties as representatives.\n",

One MP wrote: \"The feeling of not being able to protect my children was unexpected, as was having panic buttons fitted.\" One revealed she had \"worries for the safety of my parents in the constituency\", while another found she was \"more protective of my family and info on where they live/go to school\". In the wide-ranging survey, female politicians were asked for their views on getting more women into Parliament. More than half were in favour of all-female shortlists, while almost half wanted a crackdown on \"unprofessional or sexist\" language at Westminster. But the idea of allowing breastfeeding in the chamber was resoundingly rejected. One MP said: \"I wouldn't breastfeed my baby if I worked on the checkout at Tesco, so why would I do it in the chamber?\" Two-thirds of those who responded to the survey said getting more women elected would mean Parliament would make better decisions. One commented that \"less time would be wasted. Too much hot air from men\". Another said: \"Parliament might be run more sensibly - less time wasted on posturing\n",

Most people care about the fate of Greece, and hope that it can maintain stability and feel secure. Many people, but by no means all, believe that its membership of \"Club Europe\" is one guarantee of a stability which has so often been denied to Greece in the past. For at least the past hundred years, Greece has swung between democracy and dictatorship, between civilian and military rule, and the outside world would like to be sure the pendulum now stays firmly in the position marked \"democratic, civilian government\". Both history and geography help explain why Greece matters far beyond its borders. The society which gave the world the embryo of modern democracy in Ancient Greece has only enjoyed 40 years of continuous parliamentary democracy in modern times. The days of the \"Greek colonels\" are still in the not-very-distant past. The last military regime in Athens was overthrown in 1974. Thirty years earlier, in 1944, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, as uncomfortable wartime allies against the Nazis, were carving up the Balkans between East and West for the post-war era. In Moscow, Churchill put it to Stalin: \"Let us settle about our affairs in the Balkans.\" Britain's wartime leader wrote down his proposals in pencil on a sheet of paper: A couple of later additions and amendments in red ink are important. The Greece section is changed so that \"the others 10%\" becomes \"Russia 10%\". And after Great Britain's claim to 90% influence has been added the words \"in accord with USA\", recognising where the real post-war power would lie. It was part of the far larger, so-called \"percentages agreement\" attempting to parcel out Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Hungary too. There's a blue pencil tick near the top of the page, apparently in Stalin's hand. He may have honoured that limit to his influence in Greece, but certainly not his apparent agreement to share Hungary and Bulgaria. After that, Churchill moved very swiftly to try to ensure that the Greek Communists - who had been such a strong force in the divided Resistance to Nazi occupation - would not prevail. He made\n",

Or in the words of the recycling industry, it has become an end-of-life vehicle.

Remembering the car was 12 years old, I chirpily mention that a £150 cheque from a scrap merchant would come in handy. \"£150? Lucky to get £50,\" says George. George sits in his office outside the tiny Cornish village of Doublebois and patiently explains the macroeconomic forces at play that have reduced my car to a hunk of worthless metal. China, he reckons, is the problem. With Chinese demand falling, the price of iron ore is on the way down and scrap metal prices are following in their wake. A year ago George could have got £160 for my car. During the Beijing Olympics prices skyrocketed. Not now. \"There's a worldwide glut of metal,\" he explains. And Y264 TKP is 75% metal, albeit dented and scratched by bike racks, my mother's gate post and, for reasons too complex to go into, the teeth of a small pony.

He said it was a sign of the Farc's \"unconditional commitment to peace\" after more than 50 years of conflict. The government has yet to reach a peace deal with the ELN rebel group. The Farc said its fighters would register their weapons with UN monitors and reveal the location of any stashed explosives. Almost 7,000 rebels are now gathered in 26 transition zones where they are being registered and offered help to reintegrate into civilian life. But it took months rather than weeks to get them there because of what the government said were logistical difficulties. And when they arrived many Farc members complained the camps were unfinished and they had to build their own accommodation. The Colombian government and the Farc insist that by 30 May - the date set in the peace accord for the disarmament process to be completed - all the guerrillas will be leaving the transition zones and entering civilian life. But there have been serious delays, and the government and the rebels are trying to reassure Colombians that the peace process is still on track. According to the original plan, the Farc were supposed to hand over 30% of their arms on 1 March. But now only 320 rebels are set to disarm by the end of Wednesday, far short of the original target.

No evidence was found,\" police said. \"We now believe that there was never any real danger.\" All 151 passengers were evacuated from the Airbus 319 aircraft using emergency slides, and nine received medical treatment. The men, aged 31, 38 and 48, were returning to Stansted, in Essex, from Ljubljana on 10 June when the disruption arose. They are said to have been on a business trip. According to prosecutors, the flight was diverted when fellow passengers reported the men were discussing \"terrorist matters\" and carrying a book entitled \"Kill\" with a sniper rifle on the cover. They said the contents of the alleged conversation could not be verified. No explosives were found in the passengers' luggage or on the plane. A backpack belonging to the men was nonetheless blown up by police.

Often, it said in a blogpost, the best answers to a query were found in an app rather than a web page. Initially nine apps have been selected to work with the streaming system as it is tested. Jennifer Lin, Google engineering manager, said the firm started indexing information found in apps two years ago to bolster its larger corpus of search data. About 40% of searches done via Google now turn up content found in apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb or Pinterest, she said. Until now, Google has only answered queries with information that is available both on the web and in apps. Now, however, it is starting to show results that are only found in apps. One example of when these results would show up might be when someone is looking for hotels during a spur-of-the-moment trip to an unfamiliar city, wrote Ms Lin in the blog. Google said it was using an in-house developed streaming system to give people access to results in apps they do not have installed on their Android handsets. This lets people try the app and use it as if it were installed, said Ms Lin. An experimental cloud-based virtualisation technology Google has developed underpins the streaming system. Apps from HotelTonight, Useful Knots, Daily Horoscope and Gormey are among the first to be available via streaming. Danny Sullivan, founding editor of the Search Engine Land news site, said the streaming system made visible a lot of information that was hard to get at easily. \"It's a bad experience to show links to an app that no-one can view unless they install an app,\" he said. Plus, he added, it could mean data found in apps was now more widely available and could be put to other uses. \"Potentially, the new system could even cause some apps that might seem to lack linkable content, such as games, to consider app-only links,\" he wrote. Streamed versions of apps are available via Google's own app and on its Chrome browser.

Mr Trump has also said he wants the US to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. But President Obama says this would see the US lose its \"seat at the table\". The President's views appeared in a policy forum article in the highly regarded research journal, Science. The editors believe it is the first time that a sitting President has written such a feature. In the article, the President argues that a \"massive scientific record\" shows that climate change is \"real and cannot be ignored\". Mr Obama also details the reasons he believes the trend towards a low-carbon economy is now \"irreversible\". He points to the fact that between 2008 and 2015 the US economy grew by 10% while emissions of CO2 fell by almost the same amount. Mr Obama says that US businesses have increasingly seen the financial benefits from cutting carbon through greater energy efficiency. Citing the examples of corporations like General Motors and Alcoa, the President says the US consumed 2.5% less energy in 2015 than in 2008 while the economy was now a tenth bigger. There would be a huge financial penalty if economies don't reduce their emissions, Mr Obama writes. If CO2 continues to rise then global temperatures could go up by 4 degrees C by the end of this century, and that could cost the world economy 4% of GDP. In US terms that would equate to the loss of federal revenue of between $340bn and $690bn every year. Pointedly, Mr Obama says that 2.2 million Americans now work in jobs connected to energy efficiency - double the 1.1 million that work in fossil fuel production and electricity generation. Thanks to hydraulic fracturing, gas has emerged as a transformative energy source, now accounting for 33% of US electricity production. Despite Mr Trump's plans to revive the coal industry by cutting red tape, \"it is unlikely that utilities will change course and choose to build coal-fired power plants, which would be more expensive than natural gas plants, regardless of any near-term changes in federal policy.\" Even states that supported Donald Trump in the presidential election had moved heavily to renewables.

Scottish GDP per person - which takes population changes into account - was also flat during the first quarter of 2016. During the first three months of the year services in Scotland grew by 0.4%, while production contracted by 1.2% and construction by 1.5%. On an annual basis, Scotland's economy grew by 0.6%, compared with UK growth of 2%. The figures were compiled by Scotland's chief statistician. The GDP figures were released on the same day as official data showed that unemployment in Scotland fell by 18,000 between March and May. A leading economic forecaster described the two sets of figures as \"a mixed bag\" for the Scottish economy. Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute at the University of Strathclyde, said growth had been \"stagnant\" over the first three months of the year. \"While the all-important services sectors grew, there was a sharp fall in production and construction,\" he said. \"Of greatest concern was the fall in manufacturing, which was down 2.6% over the three months and 5.4% over the year. This was the sharpest fall in annual manufacturing output since the 2008/09 financial crisis. \"On the plus side, revisions to the data paint a rosier picture of growth last year.

Mrs Carson later died at the scene from multiple injuries. Ferris admitted causing her death by dangerous driving. He was jailed for nine years and six months. Jailing Ferris at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Turnbull told him: \"Your behaviour on that evening, when seen in the context of your previous offending, demonstrates you have no sense of the civilised values by which others in our community live their lives.\" Lord Turnbull said Mrs Carson had been a mother and wife \"in the prime of her life\" who, through the random timing of taking her dog for a walk, found herself in the path of a drunk driver travelling at excessive speed. He said the author of a background report on Ferris could \"detect little by way insight or genuine remorse\" on his part. \"The consequence of your conduct was predictable, but it was also truly tragic for Mrs Carson and her family,\" he said. A previous hearing at the High Court in Glasgow was told that on the day of the crash Ferris had been drinking Buckfast and was \"pretty drunk\". At about 20:00, Mrs Carson left her home in Gresham View, Motherwell, to walk the family dog. Ferris was seen driving the Mondeo at excessive speed, causing some witnesses to remark that he was \"flying past\" and driving \"like an idiot\". He then lost control on Muirhouse Road, causing the car to mount the pavement, hit Mrs Carson and then smash into a wall.

The heart of the financial package is infrastructure spending - £400m of it over two years. That is a significant sum given that Northern Ireland's annual infrastructure budget is about £1bn. The deal specifically mentions the York Street Interchange, a project to ease congestion where three major roads meet in Belfast. It is expected to cost about £150m, so there should be plenty left over for other major projects. They could include a planned transport hub in the centre of Belfast and other major roads schemes like the completion of the A5 or A6. On top of the £400m, there is a further £150m for ultra-fast broadband. This was a project which was already being scoped by the Department of the Economy before the collapse of Stormont. It is ultimately about improving the connectivity of rural businesses. Previous Stormont/Westminster deals have also included infrastructure but they typically involved allowing Stormont to borrow more. This time it is cold, hard, no-strings-attached cash. The money for health and education is more modest - given that a figure of £1bn for health alone was being mentioned during the negotiations. There is a minimum of £250m for health and and we can assume it will get about half the \"immediate pressures\" money, bringing it to a total of £300m. That will help ease the problems with waiting lists and give the system some breathing space ahead of a major reform programme. The \"immediate pressures\" money for education (about £50m) will go some way to easing a growing row with head teachers who have said they will not impose any more cuts. There is also £100m to be spent on deprived communities over five years. It will be interesting to see what the delivery mechanism for that money will be. Stormont's Social Investment Fund, which was also designed to help those communities, has been mired in controversy. Another part of this deal is to give flexibility to a previously agreed £500m fund for investment in shared education and housing projects.

The company has also become mired in a corruption scandal in its home country. \"The Galaxy S8 is arguably the most important launch of the last 10 years for Samsung and every aspect will be under the microscope following the Note 7 recall,\" commented Ben Wood from the CCS tech consultancy. \"The S8 is a unquestionably a strong product but Samsung must now deliver a faultless launch to move on from its earlier difficulties. If this happens it will emerge in an even stronger position.\" The new devices will be released on 21 April. The S8 is priced at £690 and the S8+ at £780 - a jump on last year's entry prices of £569 for the S7 and £639 for the S7 Edge. Samsung was the bestselling handset manufacturer for 2016 as a whole, according to market research firm IDC. However, Apple overtook it in the final three months. Source: IDC The displays of the S8 and S8+, measuring 5.8in (14.7cm) and 6.2in (15.7cm) respectively, mean a more stretched aspect ratio than before, pushing the screens closer to the top and bottom of the handsets. As a consequence, Samsung's logo no longer features on the front, and the physical home button is replaced with an on-screen icon - in a similar manner to rival Android phones from Huawei and LG. A pressure sensor and vibration module have, however, been built into the space behind the new virtual button to provide feedback. Samsung suggests the displays' 18.5:9 ratio makes them better suited to running two apps side by side. For example, there is now space to watch a video, use a chat app and still have room for a full touch-keyboard. The screens are the same resolution as before but are now brighter, supporting high dynamic range (HDR) playback\n",

But he is one of seven out-of-contract players to leave a club that failed to achieve an instant return to the Premier League and are currently without a permanent manager. \"Going back to when I was first here, Paul Lambert took what was a calculated risk, I'd say, of £250,000. \"You look back on that now, it's not an awful lot of money. I'm not sure you get too much goalkeeper for £250,000 these days,\" said Ruddy. \"I was grateful to him, to (majority shareholder) Delia Smith and (former chief executive) David McNally for allowing me to join the club, for the years after that, apart from this season and last season, have been superb. \"Four of the seven years here have been in the Premier League.

The glass roof of the conference centre was dark with snow. But since then, a remarkable set of changes has allowed the Paris Agreement to take shape. Paris climate deal enters force as focus shifts to action UN review says carbon plans fall well short of climate goals For a start, the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and US, jointly decided to make a serious push. For President Obama, this has always been a priority. And for China the new middle class is demanding an end to the toxic pollution smothering the biggest cities. And that's spurred another shift: renewable energy is falling in price. Out in the deserts of western China, along the ancient Silk Road, I've seen for myself new forests of wind turbines. Recently, China has planted two of them every hour. The Chinese push for renewable energy is the largest the world has ever seen. And look at the global figure for solar panels installed last year - it was half a million every day. A third big change is the involvement of leading companies. A decade ago, it was rare for me to get a corporate press release making a green boast. Now my inbox is bursting with them. On Friday, 10 oil companies announced a one-billion-dollar fund for low-carbon technology - something inconceivable not long ago but, let's be clear, the sum is dwarfed by the money spent developing new sources of oil. So will the Paris Agreement get anywhere? On the one hand, it doesn't oblige any government to cut their greenhouse gases. But, on the other, each country's efforts will be scrutinised every five years. And although the agreement has no teeth, it does represent something unique: the first time that every nation on the planet has signed up to try to head off the worst effects of global warming.\n",

He was well known for buying and then selling the MGM film studio three times, making a profit each time. Kerkorian was reported to have died on Monday night in Los Angeles but no cause of death has been given. \"Mr Kerkorian was a quiet but powerful force behind the transformation of the Las Vegas Strip into one of the world's most popular tourist destinations,\" MGM Resorts said in a statement. A school dropout at 16, Kerkorian became a boxer and later flew dangerous missions delivering warplanes from Canada to Britain during World War Two. He carried on flying after the war and opened a charter flight business ferrying gamblers who wanted to get from Los Angeles to Las Vegas more quickly than by driving. He began buying property in Las Vegas in 1962 after selling his charter airline, which he later re-purchased. \"When you're a self-made man you start very early in life,\" he once told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \"You get a drive that's a little different, maybe a little stronger, than somebody who inherited.\" He was also a player in the automobile industry, losing a battle for control of Chrysler in the 1990s before taking stakes in General Motors and Ford in the 2000s. In May this year, Forbes magazine estimated Kerkorian's wealth at $4.2bn (£2.7bn) after taking a hit on his investments during the financial crisis in 2008, when the magazine said he was worth $16bn. \"MGM Resorts and our family of 62,000 employees are honouring the memory of a great man, a great business leader, a great community leader, an innovator, and one of our country's greatest generation,\" MGM chief executive Jim Murren said in a statement.\n",

Daryl Clark, Ben Westwood and Kevin Penny all crossed for the hosts before half-time to forge an 18-4 lead. Ryan Atkins' brace, Benjamin Jullien and Westwood's second sealed Wire's biggest Super League win over Wigan. The Warriors, for whom captain John Bateman scored a late consolation, would have gone top themselves with a win but defeat left them third. Catalans Dragons will join Warrington at the summit on 20 points if they win at Hull on Friday. The two tightest defences in the division at the start of play held firm until Charnley slid in at the corner after 17 minutes, but Shaun Wane's 150th game as Wigan head coach quickly turned sour as Clark and Westwood, who barged over with his first touch of the game, overturned the deficit. Warrington, who lost winger Tom Lineham to a head injury early in the first half, saw off a burst of Wigan pressure before Atkins' close-range try stretched the lead to 20 points and his second effectively killed the contest. The Wolves' half-back pairing of Stefan Ratchford and Kurt Gidley, who extended his contract on Wednesday, played influential roles throughout, with Gidley also landing five of his six attempts at goal. Former Great Britain international Iestyn Harris, BBC Radio 5 live sports extra \"In the first 20 minutes, Warrington didn't get into their stride.

            "Input: summarize: South and West Yorkshire would both control some tax and spending if local councils devolve powers to new combined authorities run by a mayor. Under the proposals, strategic planning, transport and economic regeneration powers would be handed over. The Chancellor, George Osborne, could announce the plan on Wednesday. The five West Yorkshire councils - Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds and Wakefield - joined the neighbouring City of York in North Yorkshire to form a combined authority six months ago. Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield councils have created a similar South Yorkshire body. The existing councils would continue to run services such as education and waste management individually. Under the current agreement one of the council leaders is chosen by the others to chair the combined authority. The chancellor's idea takes this on much further with extra powers for the combined authority to control social welfare policy, raise tax and control public spending. In return leadership would be given to a new generation of \"metro mayors\" wielding considerable executive powers. Councillor Peter Box, Labour leader of Wakefield City Council and current chair of the West Yorkshire Combined Authority, said he would welcome any extra power and budgets but totally reject a regional executive mayor. Wakefield, Bradford, Leeds and Sheffield all rejected individual city mayors in referendums just two years ago. \"Just a couple of weeks ago the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was in Leeds and told us that we could have the devolved powers without having to accept an executive mayor,\" said Mr Box. \"Go on any street and it becomes clear the public will simply not accept another elected politician.\" Andrew Carter, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on Leeds City Council, voted against creating a local executive mayor in the 2012 referendums. \"But, a metro mayor is a completely different proposition,\" he said. Support for the idea has come from two of Bradford's MPs. Gerry Sutcliffe, Labour MP for Bradford South, who was leader of the city council before being elected to parliament, says West Yorkshire has to follow the Manchester lead or it will see potential investment and economic growth being sucked over to the other side of the Pennines. George Galloway, Respect MP for Bradford West, said he believed that West Yorkshire could reap the same benefits that have resulted from the strong leadership of London'\n",

He presented himself as a practising Christian and first visited Malaysia on a teaching gap year when he was 18 or 19. He then went on to groom children while doing voluntary work. Sentencing Huckle, Judge Peter Rook QC said: \"It is very rare indeed that a judge has to sentence sexual offending by one person on such a scale as this.\" He added that Huckle's life \"revolved around your obsession with your own sexual gratification by child sex abuse\". How abuser Richard Huckle was caught Malaysian reaction to Huckle's abuse \"It is also clear that, had you not been arrested, you planned to continue the same lifestyle using the expertise that you were keen to show off to and share with other abusers so as to continue your sexual exploitation of the children of such communities.\" Investigators found more than 20,000 indecent pictures and videos of his assaults on children, which were shared with paedophiles worldwide through a website hidden in the so-called dark web He even tried to make a business out of his abuse by crowd-funding the release of the images and was compiling a paedophile's manual at the time of his arrest by the National Crime Agency in December 2014. He boasted about his crimes in online posts, saying in one discussion that \"impoverished kids are definitely much easier to seduce than middle-class Western kids.\" Ahead of his sentencing, Huckle claimed to a psychiatrist that he wanted to put his \"madness\" behind him and settle down with a south Indian woman. But the court was shown a posting from 2013 in which he outlined his plan to marry one of his victims in order to help him abuse more children.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said a cot blanket made from Tasmanian merino wool was being sent on behalf of the Australian people to mark the royal birth. It was made at the country's oldest weaving mill, Waverly Woollen Mills, Tasmania, and has been embroidered with the Australian floral emblem, the wattle. Mr Abbott said his government would also be making a A$10,000 (£5,200) donation to the Healesville Sanctuary, in Victoria, in honour of the princess. \"I hope one day the princess can visit Australia and hold a Mountain Pygmy-possum herself,\" he said.

Ulster Bank also lent the money for that development. The Outlet is currently held by an Ulster Bank company called West Register (Northern Ireland) Property. It is a Northern Ireland branch of a group of companies set up by the bank's parent company RBS to hold \"distressed properties\".

But Hurricane Julio, a Category 3 storm with winds of more than 120mph, is about 1,000 miles (1,609km) away. Hawaiian officials have urged residents to stock up on emergency supplies. The last cyclone to hit Hawaii, Hurricane Iniki in 1992, killed six and caused $2.4bn (£1.4bn) in damage. Five to eight inches of rain are forecast, along with heavy winds and potential flash flooding in some parts of the state. The storm was weakening as it hit the terrain of the eastern-most island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, according to Chris Brenchley, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Honolulu. \"As wind blows into the terrain, the terrain kind of redirects the wind,\" he said. The state's department of emergency management has asked residents to prepare a seven-day emergency kit, including non-perishable food and water. Hawaii's remoteness from the mainland makes it hard to get emergency supplies to the state. Stores have had to quickly restock bottled water and other supplies. The storm has already knocked out power for more than 18,000 people on the Big Island, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. Another 2,700 were without power on the island of Maui. At least 50 flights from major airlines were canceled on Thursday and an inter-island airline cancelled all of its flights on Friday. Rudy Cruz and Ashley Dochnahl from California told the Associated Press they had attempted to fly back early but failed to secure a flight. \"We were trying to beat it, but we now will have to ride it out,\" Mr Cruz said.

Asked if he would end the ban on secondary strike action - also known as solidarity action - brought in by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government in 1990, Mr Corbyn said: \"Yes, of course\". He added: \"Nobody willingly goes on strike. They go on strike as an ultimate weapon... So let's look at the causes of people being upset rather than the symptoms.\" Reaction to Sunday's political interviews Mr Corbyn also did not rule out allowing the return of flying pickets - where workers travels to support others' action - which were first used in the coal disputes of the 1970s. He said: \"It was merely people moving around showing support during a very difficult industrial dispute.\" Referring to the walkout by junior doctors in their dispute with the government about a new contract, Mr Corbyn said they \"would be better served if we had a health secretary who was prepared to get involved, meet them and look for a solution\". There were calls for the laws on secondary strikes to be repealed in 2005 while Labour was in power, amid action by baggage handlers at Heathrow Airport in support of sacked staff at the catering firm Gate Gourmet.

In the meantime, it's looking bleak for the Black Cats of Sunderland at the other end of the table. After 10 games, they have just two points in the bag, are bottom of the pile and have just a 19% chance of avoiding the drop into the Championship. Gracenote say they will finish on 28 points, well adrift of safety, although they will not be the worst side in Premier League history. They will not even be the worst Sunderland side in the top flight. The Black Cats managed 15 points in 2005-06 and 19 in 2002-03, relegated to the Championship on both occasions. There is a sliver of hope for Sunderland boss David Moyes, though. Crystal Palace and Everton managed just three points from their opening 10 matches in the 2013-14 and 1994-95 seasons respectively but stayed up. For the record, the worst Premier league performers are Derby County, who collected just 11 points - one win and eight draws - in 2007-08. It will perhaps come as no surprise to learn that Leicester City's hopes of retaining their crown are already over. According to Gracenote, the Foxes have a 0.1% chance of emulating their success of last season. Currently 11th, they are predicted to finish eighth. It is looking bleak, too, for Manchester United. Their title chances are rated at just 1.3% by Gracenote, who think Jose Mourinho's side will finish in sixth on 64 points, well adrift of the top four. That is one place lower and two points fewer than last season, which ended with an FA Cup victory but with manager Louis van Gaal losing his job. Worse news for United fans is that neighbours Manchester City will finish top, pipping Arsenal on goal difference. Gracenote predicted City and the Gunners would battle it out for the title before the season started and the duo are currently locked on 23 points at the top.

In June, militants fired an anti-tank missile at a vehicle convoy carrying construction workers helping to build the new border fence. One Israeli construction worker and two of the attackers were killed. Analysts say that the security situation in Sinai has deteriorated following the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last year, and that local Bedouin criminal gangs, radical Palestinian groups and possibly militant Islamists sympathetic to al-Qaeda have gained a foothold. By Kevin ConnollyBBC News, Jerusalem Israel's border with Egypt in the baking, hostile wilderness of the Sinai desert was among the most dangerous flashpoints in the Middle East until the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979. They had been to war four times there in the previous 30 years. Under Anwar Sadat and then Hosni Mubarak, Egypt kept an iron grip on the region offering Israel such strategic certainty that the border between the two countries was not properly fenced. Since the fall of Mubarak concern is deepening in Israel that Egypt is less able, or less willing to maintain the same degree of control. There have been a series of incursions over the last year - in the most serious, militants killed 16 Egyptian soldiers before blasting their way through the border fence. Israel fears more - and is building a fence which will run the entire length of the frontier. This latest attack came at one of the last points where work is still to be completed. Lt Col Leibovich said the militants who crossed the border from the Sinai peninsula on Friday were heavily armed with rifles and equipped with bullet-proof vests and explosive belts.

Observers in north and central America, and the northern-most parts of South America saw the event start just before local sunset. The far northwest of America, the Arctic, the western Pacific, and east Asia witnessed the entire passage. While the UK and the rest of Europe, the Middle East, and eastern Africa waited for local sunrise to try to see the closing stages of the transit. Venus appeared as a small black dot moving slowly but surely across the solar disc. The traverse lasted more than six and a half hours. Some of the best pictures of the event were provided by the US space agency's (Nasa) Solar Dynamics Observatory, which studies the Sun from a position 36,000km above the Earth. \"We get to see Venus in exquisite detail because of SDO's spatial resolution,\" said agency astrophysicist Dr Lika Guhathakurta. \"SDO is a very special observatory. It takes images that are about 10 times better than a high-definition TV and those images are acquired at a temporal cadence of one every 10 seconds. This is something we've never had before.\" Many citizens keen to observe the transit first hand attended special events at universities and observatories where equipment for safe viewing had been set up. In Hawaii, one of the best places to see the whole event, the university's Institute of Astronomy set up telescope stations on Waikiki beach. \"We've had 10 telescopes and the queues have been 10 deep to each telescope all day long,\" said the institute's Dr Roy Gal. \"It's a great opportunity to get people excited and teach them stuff. I was hoping for a big turn-out, and it's been fantastic,\" he told BBC News. Joe Cali viewed the transit on the edge of the Outback in New South Wales, Australia, another ideal vantage point. \"It is exciting. It may look like just a black dot on the Sun but if you think about it, it's one of the few times you get to see a planet in motion,\" he said.

Smith used a passport in his birth name, Phillip Traynor, to fly to Chile and then go to Brazil on 6 November. He escaped while on a three-day release from a prison south of Auckland. Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 after he murdered the father of a 13-year-old boy he had sexually abused between 1992 and 1995. The family had moved house but he had tracked the boy to their new home in Wellington in December 1995. He repeatedly stabbed the father, killing him. The boy managed to escaped and raise the alarm. The victim, who is now 30, told New Zealand's Fairfax media after news of Smith's capture, that he could now stop sleeping with a knife under his pillow. \"It's great news, it's excellent,\" he said from his new home in Australia. \"[I feel] relief, a bit of peace of mind that I can carry on with my life without having that fear over my shoulder.\" Smith's escape has thrown Corrections and various other government agencies into controversy. It has led to calls for an overhaul of short-term prison release and the monitoring of high-risk offenders. In an email Smith sent to Radio New Zealand he said he had planned the escape by running a criminal check on his birth name and discovering that it had not been red-flagged. \"My only anxiety was that somebody that knew me might happen to be at the airport at the same time to identify me,'' he wrote, according to Radio NZ. He also said he had been able to fund the escape with money from various businesses he had run from prison. Smith said he chose Brazil because he thought it would be more difficult to extradite him if he was caught, as the two countries do not have a formal extradition treaty. He was arrested after a member of the public in Rio De Janeiro recognised him from images being circulated in hostels and tipped off police. Smith appeared in court after his arrest and has been remanded in custody for 60 days. New Zealand Police Detective Superintendent Mike Pannett said in a press conference on Thursday that it was\n",

West was filmed shouting racist abuse at passengers travelling on a tram between Croydon and Wimbledon. She was bound over to keep the peace and handed a 24-month community order. A judge said West was clearly suffering from mental health problems at the time of the outburst. She received a mental health treatment order for assaulting a constable in a separate incident. The court heard she was \"reeking of alcohol\" when she carried out the verbal attack. Prosecutor Julius Capon said: \"She in essence persecuted a number of passengers on the tram, subjecting them to some disgusting racial abuse.\" The things she said included \"you're not English\", \"none of you are English\" and \"get back to your own countries\". Mr Capon said many of the passengers were \"upset\" by West's behaviour. \"Some of them described themselves as being disgusted, shocked and horrified,\" he said. David Martin-Sperry, defending West, said the defendant's offending was out of character, she was taking anti-depressants and she does not harbour any racist views. Mr Martin-Sperry said she had unwittingly taken two and a half times the recommended dose and drunk a large glass of wine before launching the tirade.\n",

Civil partnerships gained legal recognition in the UK in 2006. Allan Bell, MHK, Minister for Economic Development, who tabled the bill says gay rights have been brought in line with the UK after a 20-year battle. \"It has been an extremely difficult time for gay people wishing to have open, loving caring relationships,\" he said. \"But gay rights have changed beyond recognition over the last 20 years on the island. It is a very different place now, it is more tolerant, understanding and inclusive.\" The Isle of Man has its own parliament and own laws, some of which are very different to those in the UK. Abortion laws are much stricter, the death penalty was only abolished in 1993 and homosexuality was illegal until 1992. Same-sex couples on the island have welcomed the bill claiming they have been discriminated against for years. One man told the BBC that he and his partner were forced to take HIV tests in order to get a mortgage and life insurance on the island. \"I told our broker in no uncertain terms that I didn't want to take out a policy with someone who discriminated against gay people but most on them on the island weren't prepared to give a policy unless the HIV test was taken,\" he said. Mr Bell said the island used to have \"a very negative image with the UK and Europe\". \"The island was subject to a boycott of the UK trade unions who used to use the island for a lot of their conferences,\" he said. \"We are trying to compete internationally for business and there is still the suspicion that we tend to be a backward society.\" \"That is no longer the case.

He found fame with his 1948 single Guitar Boogie and enjoyed other hits including Feudin' Banjos in 1955. When the Warner Bros film studio used a cover version and renamed it Dueling Banjos for Deliverance, he sued them and won substantial royalties.

Newcastle had taken the lead in extra time when Mohamed Diame prodded home Vurnon Anita's cross to score against his former club. The lead lasted a minute, Robert Snodgrass equalising after Matz Sels had spilled Markus Henriksen's shot into his path. Mbokani was sent off in the 89th minute for lunging forward with his head at Jamaal Lascelles. The tie only came to life in extra time, the first 90 minutes featuring just two shots on target. Newcastle have now lost nine of their 10 penalty shootouts in all competitions, yet Rafael Benitez's side will be wondering why they did not win the tie in 120 minutes. They had 32 shots in that time, but their finishing was as wayward as their penalties. Jonjo Shelvey set the tone for Newcastle's spot-kick nightmare when his attempt was kept out by Jakupovic. Hull's first penalty fell to Snodgrass and he made no mistake, before Dwight Gayle hit the bar with his attempt for Newcastle. Skipper Michael Dawson made it 2-0 before Christian Atsu scored for Newcastle. Tom Huddlestone made it 3-1, and Hull's players and fans were celebrating a first EFL Cup semi-final appearance when Jakupovic kept out Yoan Gouffran's tame attempt. Hull had just one shot on target in normal time, and their hopes of reaching the semi-finals looked over when Mbokani was sent off. The forward, on loan from Dynamo Kiev, kicked out and pushed Lascelles before lunging forward at the Newcastle defender with his head.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage told BBC News that Mr Smith had resigned \"by mutual consent\", and described his behaviour as \"loutish and wholly inappropriate\". He said UKIP had had \"great difficulty\" with the Basildon selection, adding: \"The party has got to grip this and sort it out, in short order\". Mr Farage also said UKIP's national executive committee had the power to impose a candidate if it wanted. UKIP hopes to make a serious challenge for the South Basildon and East Thurrock seat in the forthcoming general election, in which it is seeking to win a handful of seats and potentially hold the balance of power. But Mr Smith's resignation, four days after he was re-adopted as a candidate, capped a week of negative headlines for the party. Mr Hamilton pulled out of contention for the seat amid questions raised by the party over his expenses while another candidate, Natasha Bolter, withdrew amid an investigation into allegations she made against Mr Bird, whose job is to vet election candidates.

He was part of England's squad for the Rugby World Cup, in which they were eliminated at the group stage, and played in the hosts' crucial 28-25 defeat by Wales. Burgess said criticism directed at him following his performance in that match had contributed to his feeling of unease in rugby union. \"A lot of people outside the England camp had an agenda against both England and, in some circumstances, me,\" he wrote in the Daily Mail. \"This was an upsetting factor to me, that people who are supposed to love the game are actually tearing it to shreds. \"Some ex-players just kept letting rip. It's almost like they don't want anyone else to do well in the jersey. I didn't want to stay in a sport like that.\" Burgess also said he had not found the 15-man code as enjoyable as rugby league. \"I want to spend the rest of my career playing the game that's in my heart,\" said Burgess, who played 21 games for Bath as a blind-side flanker after switching codes last year. \"What makes me love [rugby league] is the physical battle of it; I never found myself reaching that point [in union]. \"My heart just isn't in [rugby union], and if my heart's not in it then [Bath and England] won't get the best performances from me.\" He said he was satisfied with his displays at the World Cup and believed coach Lancaster had been unfairly criticised after the team's early exit. Burgess, whose selection for the World Cup squad ahead of the established Luther Burrell reportedly caused disquiet in the England camp, said his decision to quit union had dismayed his international and club team-mates. \"I wanted to go in and see [the Bath squad], but Stuart Hooper, our captain, said he didn't think I'd be well received there, which was fair enough,\" he said.\n",

Sara Connor, 46, and her British boyfriend David James Taylor, 33, are both on trial for Mr Sudarsa's murder. In court on Tuesday, his widow Ketut Arsini said she would not accept \"even a cent\" from Ms Connor. The Australian woman read extracts to the Denpasar hearing of a handwritten letter she had sent to Ms Arsini offering 25m rupiah (£1500; $1900). \"I am not a rich person but to express my sympathy and my sadness I would like you to accept a donation of 25 million rupiah to help you and your children in this difficult moment,\" Ms Connor said. People in the courtroom applauded when Ms Arsini said she did not want any money. \"I want the court to give the maximum punishment that fits what she did, based on Indonesian laws,\" Ms Arsini said. Ms Connor again claimed her innocence, saying she tried to separate Mr Taylor and Mr Sudarsa after they began fighting over her missing handbag. She told Ms Arsini she felt \"great pain\" over the tragedy. \"I'm deeply sorry for you and your family now left alone without Mr Sudarsa to care for you and your children. You have been always in my prayers,\" Ms Connor said. Both Ms Connor and Mr Taylor face up to 15 years in jail if they are found guilty of murder.

But, according to Times Higher Education, an \"offshore King's College Europe\" is now on the cards. King's College confirmed that it was discussing potential further collaborations with TU Dresden. The two institutions already offer 10 joint professorships and several joint PhD programmes through Transcampus. However, its dean, Prof Stefan Bornstein, has told Times Higher Education that plans for the new King's campus are already \"in the process\". Prof Bornstein, who is director and chairman of TU Dresden's department of medicine and an honorary consultant in diabetes and endocrinology at King's, said the plan would allow King's to have a presence in Europe and maintain access to European research funding post-Brexit. Likewise, he said, TU Dresden would benefit from increased ties to London, one of the \"leading academic centres in the world\". Prof Bornstein said the new campus would hopefully run new undergraduate courses \"linked to innovation and the needs of industry and society\". The aim would be to recruit leading scholars from around the world, he added. Prof Bornstein said the Transcampus project had been envisaged before the EU referendum but admitted that it had become \"a lot more interesting\" since the vote. \"We cannot allow things that have developed for so many years in a positive way [to be] hampered by political decisions that actually nobody wanted,\" he said. \"It's a nice way to have a solution to get around this very stupid Brexit idea.\" A number of UK universities are believed to be considering opening branch campuses in Europe after Brexit - though earlier this year Oxford University rejected reports that it was in talks to open a Paris campus. Prof Bornstein said he would expect the Transcampus model to be replicated by other universities in the UK and Europe, but stressed that the key was a long history of collaboration between researchers at the two institutions. In a statement, King's said the university valued the Transcampus initiative \"which demonstrates the success of cross-national and institutional links\". \"We will continue to work together in various fields on research and exchange and discuss potential further collaborations.\"\n",

His brace against Wasps caught the national for the first time, but he still found fault in his own performance. \"I don't think I carried the ball as much as I have in previous games,\" Williams said. \"I made a lot of tackles as we spent a lot of time without the ball.

In a keynote speech at an event organised by the American Bar Association in London, Garcia added: \"The natural next step of the development of an effective ethics process at Fifa is greater transparency. \"The second element that is vital to fulfilling the promise of this reform process is tone at the top. \"More simply put, the second element an institution like Fifa needs in order to meet the challenge of ethics enforcement is leadership.

He began as a record-breaking junior world champion powerlifter. Then, after suffering a serious spinal injury, he embarked on an illustrious handcycling career. Marsden raced on the European circuit while based in the Czech Republic, before a neck problem again saw him admitted into the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in 2009 for what he thought was a prolapsed disc. Instead it was revealed that he suffers with a rare motor-neurone condition which affects his arms, legs and brain. \"Through powerlifting I damaged my back many years ago, and after that I managed to damage my neck and had a couple of plates and (carbon) cage put in,\" the 44-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent told BBC East Midlands Today. In a matter-of-fact manner, Marsden says his sporting journey \"has not been an easy one\". When handcycling was no longer an option, he took up air rifle shooting and set his sights on London 2012, but while more representative honours came his way, he missed out on the Paralympics. Eventually, he turned to the water where he was able to combine aspects of his his first two sporting loves - powerlifting and handcycling - together in one explosive sport. \"I didn't want to give up on sport,\" he said. \"The cycling and powerlifting work quite well with the para-canoe - the gym work, the power and strength and then you have the endurance and speed work on the bike.\" The two-time para-canoe European champion and two-time world silver medallist now wants to realise his Paralympic ambition in Brazil when the British line-up is decided at the trials in Nottingham in June. \"It would be the highlight of my sporting career,\" Marsden said. \"As a kid I watched TV and watched the Olympics.

The French mandate ended in 1943, after 23 years of colonial rule, ushering in the new republic. But it was in the 1950s that architecture, interior and product design flourished fusing European and Arab influences. The economic emphasis shifted from agriculture to industry, tourism and trade, creating a new skyline, and growing consumerism encouraged brand advertising. A 1960s poster (pictured) for Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national carrier, which began flying the newly wealthy to international destinations. The French-designed poster suggests it's made of mosaic while appearing modern, and designer Jacques Auriac - also responsible for the creating iconic French cigarette packets - conjured up posters to destinations beyond the immediate region. Opening its doors in late 1967, the boutique L'Artisan du Liban et L'Orient was the response of May El Khoury, the wife of an eminent architect, to the trauma of defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The defeat eroded confidence and left a profound impression on the Arab psyche. Modernising overlooked local crafts and selling them in a chic setting might be interpreted as an act of cultural activism. It softened the humiliation of military defeat for the middle classes, who were attracted to the new Arab aesthetic and to the idea of patriotism through ethical consumerism. The desire to create a contemporary Islamic architecture marked architect Assem Salam's early career in reaction to the 1967 war. Along with Pierre Khoury he felt the construction of specifically Lebanese-Arab religious buildings would revive spirits crushed by the defeat and designed the Khashoggi Mosque (pictured above). After the civil war he founded an association for the preservation of historic buildings seeking to slow down the rush to reconstruct Beirut at the cost of cultural heritage. The nightclub known as B 018 was designed by Bernard Khoury in 1998 in the Quarantaine, the Beirut neighbourhood that saw some of the worst atrocities during the conflict. It has its roots in the 1980s in the thick of the civil war when gatherings were held at\n",

But before I'm accused of completely failing to perform basic contractual duties, allow me to explain why those seven words are rather important. Since 2013, the BBC and almost every other leading news organisation in the UK has been locked in a bizarre battle to tell you the truth about Erol Incedal. \"Who he?\" I hear you ask. He's a student from London who was accused of preparing some kind of major terrorism plan. And then after two trials he was found not guilty of that allegation. But I can't tell you why. The prosecution of Erol Incedal has been, without a shadow of a doubt, the strangest criminal trial that those of us who report on the law have ever seen. Apologies. I meant to write \"not really seen much of\" because almost all of what happened was behind closed doors. And now the Court of Appeal has ruled that the unprecedented gagging order in the case will remain in place forever. Incedal was charged with another man, Mounir Rarmoul Bouhadjar, in October 2013. Rarmoul Bouhadjar admitted possessing bomb-making plans. Incedal denied the allegation, saying he had a reasonable excuse for holding them. In 2014, a jury convicted him of that, but they failed to agree whether he was guilty of a more serious charge of preparing an act of terrorism. At a retrial the following year, a fresh jury cleared him. I don't know why that jury cleared him. If I did, I couldn't tell you. Some of my colleagues do however know. But they can't tell me. Or you. They'd be in Contempt of Court and could end up in prison. Erol Incedal's trials involved an unprecedented level of secrecy in courts that are normally open to the public. There were brief periods of public evidence and then slightly longer periods when a group of accredited journalists were allowed in to listen to some of the mysterious evidence. The third and highest level of the case operated in complete secrecy, with the media totally banned. At the end of each secret session that journalists could attend, police took their notebooks and put them in a safe. Where are those notebooks now? You know\n",

Lowry-Huws' wife Susan, 63, who got a suspended sentence, must pay back the largest amount of £75,790. The three were convicted of conspiracy to defraud along with two others. At a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Mold Crown Court, it was agreed Antony Lowry-Huws and Whalley made £4m each from their crimes.

His wife, who was said to be on the periphery of the scam and under the influence of her husband, benefited £896,351 and must pay back £75,790. During the trial, the court heard mortgage lenders were conned into lending thousands of pounds in mortgages on properties across north Wales, Cheshire and the north west of England. The prosecution said the deceit was achieved by inflating the value of the property used as security, hiding that in some cases no deposit was put down, or inflating the rental income potential to make the mortgage rate more acceptable.

Tony Blair's former spokesman is urging support for \"anyone but Corbyn\" in the leadership vote, arguing that the Islington North MP could never win a general election. Mr Corbyn, a backbencher who was seen as a rank outsider at the start of the campaign, has been packing out meeting halls across the UK, with many of his supporters joining the Labour Party to vote for him. The party has gained 79,000 members since the general election and 145,000 registered supporters. If the findings of the YouGov poll were repeated in the leadership election, Mr Corbyn would win without the need for second preferences to be counted. YouGov president Peter Kellner said he \"would personally be astonished if Corbyn does not end up as Labour's leader\" despite voting not starting until Friday and the result not being declared until 12 September. But others were warning about reading too much into one poll, given the difficulties of carrying out a representative survey of Labour's membership and those who have signed up as party supporters. Joe Twyman, also from YouGov, cautioned that the poll was a snapshot and there was still \"a lot to play for\" for all of the candidates in the race. \"The ballot papers haven't gone out, we've still got a month to go.

However, if they do, they will have done it the hard way, because the first-day performance with the bat was below their best, with too many players getting in, then getting out. All the talk surrounding England after their convincing win in the first Test concerned the prospect of them finding some consistency, particularly with the bat. Could they nail another good performance to put this series out of South Africa's reach? On this first day in Cape Town, they had the opportunity to do just that after winning the toss and batting first in ideal conditions on a good pitch. But too many of the top order - Alastair Cook, Alex Hales, Nick Compton and Joe Root - did the hard part and then got out. England want to play freely and busily, they want to be ticking along and that is a fair enough approach. But allied to that is the need to build a careful platform, especially when so many things are in your favour. In these conditions, four wickets down at the close would have been about right, so it can be argued that England lost one too many. That they ended the day with the upper hand was thanks to Stokes who, after a relatively lean spell, once again showed what a fine cricketer he is with an unbeaten 74. The Durham man is a proper all-rounder, always ready to contribute with bat and ball. If one part of his game isn't firing, then he will probably deliver with the other. On top of that, he is a brilliant fielder. Stokes is a fierce competitor and he further demonstrated that in the way he shredded the second new ball late in the day. South Africa had built up to that point, putting all their eggs in one basket in the hope that more wickets would come. For Stokes to then smash the ball around must have been pretty deflating. Yes, he took a chance, but he also created his own luck. He forced South Africa to remove their catchers and go on the defensive. It is performances like this that show Stokes to be a rarity in the world game. It's\n",

            "Input: summarize: The Office for National Statistics said there were 3.5 million such households in the UK between April and June this year, about 17.1% of all households including a working age adult. This was down from 3.7 million, or 17.9%, a year earlier. The highest percentage of workless households was in north-east England. Some 23% of households including a working age adult were workless in the region. The lowest was in south-east England, where 13% of households were in this category. Workless households are defined as homes where no-one aged from 16 to 64 is in employment. This could be because they are looking for work, or they have chosen not to work, or they are unable to work. People may choose not to work because of family commitments, early retirement or study. They may be unable to work because of sickness or disability. The data shows that the number of workless households in the UK dropped by 182,000 over the year. This means that 4.9 million people aged 16 to 64 lived in workless households. The ONS said this was the first time the figure had dropped below five million since 2008. Some 14% of all children in the UK, or 1.6 million, were living in these households. About two-thirds of them were in single-parent households. Children's charities - Barnardo's and The Children's Society - said they welcomed the fact that the number of children living in workless households was falling. However, a move into work did not necessarily mean a move out of poverty, they argued. They said it was imperative for the government to reduce childcare costs for families on low incomes. The proportion of workless households was at its highest in 1996, when comparable records began, when it stood at 20.9% in the UK. This fell steadily to 17.3% in 2006 before rising to 19.2% in 2010. It has fallen relatively sharply in the past three years. In 2013, there were 297,000 households in which no adult has ever worked, down 43,000 on the previous year. If student households are excluded, this figure drops to 224,000. Mark Hoban, the Minister for Employment, said: \"Helping people off benefits and into work is one of this government's top priorities, so it is good news that the number of workless households has fallen by more than 425,000 since the coalition took office. \"By reforming the welfare system to ensure that people\n",

He was then given a regular slot on ITV variety show The Wheeltappers And Shunters Social Club, hosted by the late comedian Bernard Manning. He made the move to the BBC in 1979 and launched The Paul Daniels Magic Show, which ran for 15 years. He became one of the biggest stars on British TV, becoming known for a string of catchphrases, including the line: \"You'll like this... not a lot, but you'll like it.\" He said he had first used the line at a club in Yorkshire as a way of dealing with a heckler.

Some of the foreign troops were sent to counter the recent militant insurgency in Helmand.

A number of Afghan forces were also reported to have been wounded. The casualties occurred before the \"medevac\" helicopter was called in. Some reports said the helicopter, believed to be a UH-60 Black Hawk, had also come under fire. A US defence official said it had \"sustained damage while on the ground\" but had not been shot down. He said it remained on the ground and the military was working to recover it, but gave no further details. In 2011, 30 Americans were among 38 people killed in a Chinook helicopter crash in Wardak province. Helmand has long been a stronghold of the Taliban.

The group of three are being held responsible for the deaths of eight Turkish and one Greek immigrant between 2000 and 2006, as well as a German policewoman in 2007. Yet the existence of the group, dubbed the Zwickau cell after the name of the town where they spent most of their time in hiding, only came to light in November when two of its members died in an apparent joint suicide or murder-suicide and the third handed herself in to the authorities. The NPD has been linked to the group, though the allegations have yet to be accepted in a court of law. The trio had made a DVD in which they boasted of the killings and said they had acted to serve the German nation and its people, describing themselves as the National Socialist Underground - echoing the national socialism (Nazism) of Hitler's Germany. The story of the killers has dominated headlines in Germany for months now and given rise to one of the biggest scandals in post-war Germany. It turns out intelligence agencies had had the group under surveillance for years, and even found a bomb-making factory in their garage back in 1998. So why were the trio not stopped earlier? Why were they allowed to disappear and then stay underground? And why was it that security services blamed the murders on the Turkish mafia at the time? A right-wing motive was never investigated. The failures have prompted some to ask whether there is more than incompetence to blame, whether Germany's police and security services contain elements sympathetic to the far right - an accusation the institutions vehemently deny. A parliamentary inquiry is currently under way into their activities, and Newsnight has seen a secret internal report revealing serious blunders by law enforcement agencies.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier this week called Zionism a \"crime against humanity\" - remarks that have been widely condemned, and which Mr Kerry on Friday called \"objectionable\". On the subject of Syria, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon said on Friday he was \"personally pained and distraught\" by the ongoing violence and suffering of civilians. He said there was a \"very small window of opportunity\" for the Syrian government and the opposition to hold talks, and admitted that, for the UN, there was \"not much political space\". Mr Ban went on to say that, in his opinion, the only thing for the moment was to increase humanitarian assistance but it was \"almost impossible\" for aid agencies to provide enough relief, as they were continually \"outpaced\" by the need. The crisis in Syria has been a central issue in John Kerry's first overseas trip as secretary of state, which is taking him to 11 countries in Europe and the Middle East. He said in Ankara that the US and Turkey \"both believe the first priority is to try and have a political solution. We would like to save lives, not see them caught up in a continuing war\".

There are also huge commercial responsibilities - how do we make money and save money? - and leadership and management duties. Leadership is about creating a moral vision for where you want to take a team; management is the daily activity of getting them there. It has always seemed to me that in rich newspapers, the editor gets to focus on editing, while other people think about the commercial and managerial side of it. For instance, the Daily Mail has several busy managing editors, whereas the Evening Standard has only one. George Osborne to become Standard editor Osborne Evening Standard job prompts call for inquiry George Osborne: From history buff to austerity editor Read more from Amol At organisations that are strapped for cash - and the Standard is facing big commercial challenges - editors have to spend relatively more of their time thinking about commercial and managerial obligations. And all of that is hugely time consuming. It leaves less time than you would like for the really exciting bit: editing. Editing is an exercise in selection and judgement: what to put in and - just as important - what to leave out. Which pictures, campaigns, and above all stories to run? What's the best headline on that front page splash? Shall we give this or that person a kicking in the sports pages? And should our cartoonist really depict Nigel Farage as an amphibian yet again? When making these decisions, based on your judgement, which is in turn informed by your values and experience, an editor has three sacred loyalties - in my view, in no particular order. First, to the truth; second, to the reader; and third, to the integrity and reputation of the newspaper. Some would argue that there are other loyalties. An editor of The Catholic Herald might think they had a duty to God, for instance; an editor of Country Life might feel they had a duty to England's enchanted land; and all editors are likely to feel a duty to those paying the bills. But those earlier loyalties are supreme. They are very different to the loyalties required by political parties.

This comes as Syria says it has approved the delivery of aid to 36 regions, including 11 besieged areas. Meanwhile, air strikes in and around the northern city of Aleppo have reportedly killed 31 civilians. They included 10 people on a bus going down a road used by rebels as a supply route, rescue workers from the Syrian Civil Defence force said. Stephen O'Brien, the UN aid chief, told the Security Council that consent from Damascus was needed to carry out the air operations, diplomats who were in the closed door meeting said. The formal request would be made on Sunday, they added. The UN has 19 areas designated as \"besieged\" in the country, where an estimated 600,000 people live. The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said it had already drawn up a plan to carry out air drops but that funding was also needed. However, a senior UN official warned that air operations were \"not imminent\". Earlier, a statement by the Syrian Mission to the UN said permissions for humanitarian aid included access to Kafr Batna, Saqba, Hammura, Jisrein, Zabadin, East Harasta, Zamalka, Madaya, Foua, Kefraya and Yarmouk. Eight other towns were approved to receive medical assistance, school supplies and milk for children, including Daraya and Douma, also under siege, it said. The Syrian opposition has warned the government may open the door just enough to alleviate international pressure before restricting access again. In February, the WFP carried out a 21-pallet air drop of aid to a government-held area of Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria, which ended in failure. Of the 21 pallets, 10 were unaccounted for, seven landed in no-man's land and four were damaged. But it has since carried out 44 air drops over the city, delivering mainly rice, chickpeas and beans to meet the immediate needs of around 100,000 residents.

But how ready is the nation to focus on \"the beautiful game\"? This was meant to be France's feel-good moment. But like cherries that are always hanging just out of reach, the build-up to Euro 2016 has been interrupted by one distraction after another: Having got through all of that, on the eve of the championship, France is facing fresh strikes at the national airline, and rubbish left to rot in the street as bin-men join the rolling protests over labour reforms. It's a wonder people have any time left to think about whether Didier Deschamps has got the right men in his defence line-up for the French national side. But it's not as if football has been entirely out of the headlines either. Last month, Eric Cantona implied that the French coach had allowed racism to colour his selection for the squad. That followed an earlier scandal that saw two of the country's top players embroiled in blackmail allegations - and consequently dropped from the Euro 2016 team. So if the mood here ahead of kick-off has been, well, muted, perhaps it's no surprise. But there is, of course, another reason for the rather subdued atmosphere ahead of the games. When President Hollande arrives at the Stade de France in northern Paris tomorrow for the opening ceremony, it will be a poignant moment. Many of those watching will be remembering the night he was bundled out of the stadium during another match last November, as three suicide bombers blew themselves up outside. It was the start of France's night of terror, in which 130 people were killed on the streets of Paris. Now, the fears of police, public and politicians as they head into the tournament hang heavy in the air. The Euros are spread between 10 French cities, each requiring its own security plans. One hundred thousand police, soldiers and security guards have been detailed to protect the games but, as the interior minister points out, \"even 100% preparation cannot guarantee zero risk\".

Jake Bidwell then went close to doubling the lead when his second-half header bounced across goal, before another Djuricic attempt hit the post. Leeds striker Wood also saw a deflected effort hit the woodwork, when his shot was turned onto the post by Bees goalkeeper David Button. But, just when it looked like it might turn out to be a first defeat of the season for the hosts, Brentford's debutant substitute Woods - who had only been on the pitch for two minutes - was easily dispossessed by Antenucci and the Italian, who had come on at half-time, fired home the equaliser into the corner with his left foot.

Staff at the Southern General hospital in Glasgow had failed to spot that Mrs Gibson had pre-eclampsia. A review of baby deaths at Crosshouse Hospital was announced on Tuesday. It came after a BBC Scotland investigation revealed that there had been six so-called \"unnecessary\" deaths of babies at the hospital since 2008. \"Unnecessary\" or \"avoidable\" deaths are referred to as those where harm was caused to a healthy baby during childbirth - usually resulting in them being deprived of oxygen. Reports into some of the deaths referred to failings in monitoring of the child's heartbeat during childbirth. Speaking in the Holyrood chamber, Mr Gibson urged Health Secretary Shona Robison to make the review \"wider and deeper\" so it could look at similar cases in other hospitals across the country. His wife has previously opened up in the House of Commons about the \"devastating\" effect of losing her baby.

Judge McCreath told Gadd it was clear his victims \"were all profoundly affected\" by his abuse of them. \"You did all of them real and lasting damage and you did so for no other reason than to obtain sexual gratification for yourself of a wholly improper kind,\" he said. Judge McCreath said he assessed the seriousness of the offences by current guidelines, but he was limited to the maximum sentences that were available at the time the offences were committed, when \"the sentencing climate was less severe\". \"The offences for which I must pass sentence today took place many years ago at a time when in particular, in respect of one of them, the maximum sentence was considerably lower than that which is now available,\" he said. Judge McCreath said the modern equivalent offence of unlawful intercourse with a child under 13 would be equivalent to rape of a child, but said he was not permitted to pass a life sentence. He said the offence of attempted rape was \"so serious\" as to justify the maximum available sentence under the old regime of seven years, which he noted would be a lenient sentence under modern guidelines.

Some consumer groups say the measures do not go far enough. The Information Commissioner's Office received 120,310 complaints about \"unsolicited marketing calls\" from April-November 2013. It is illegal for companies to call domestic numbers registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS). The Telephone Preference Service runs a register that allows people to opt out of any unsolicited sales or marketing calls. Individuals can register free of charge by visiting the website. Or they can call 0845 070 0707. It takes 28 days for registration to become effective. Mobile phone numbers can also be registered, although this will not prevent unsolicited text messages. It is a legal requirement that all organisations - including charities, voluntary organisations and political parties - do not make such calls to numbers registered on the TPS unless they have the individual's consent to do so. Telephone Preference Service The rules do not apply when people consent to their details being used for marketing purposes. But BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said members of the public continued to get unwanted calls - often pre-recorded - despite being registered with the TPS. That was because not all companies were members of the Direct Marketing Association - the UK telemarketing industry body - some were overseas and some were \"good old-fashioned fraudsters\" out to steal money, he said. The problem of unwanted calls may never be fully eradicated, he added. Repeat offenders include firms inquiring about mis-sold payment protection insurance. Firms which flout the TPS rules can currently be fined up to £500,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office. Those which break media regulator Ofcom rules on silent and abandoned calls face fines of up to £2m. Critics say the system is not working because rules on enforcement are skewed in favour of rogue firms.

The FBI said 2,700 children have been rescued in such US raids since 2003. The victims in the most recent raids were almost all girls and range in age from 13 to 17. They had been prostituted in a variety of locations, including truck stops, casinos, motels as well as on social media and online advertisements. Mr Hosko said the accused had preyed on vulnerable teenagers, exploiting them over a period of time. \"Girls are enticed with compliments or offers, [asked] do they want to make some money,\" he said. \"Then they are trapped into this cycle that involves drugs, that involves physical abuse. It may involve torture.\" Since 2003, some 1,350 people have been convicted in such cases, including life prison sentences for 10 pimps, the FBI said.

Kevin McShane of the Institute of Civil Engineers told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme that it was a surprise \"nothing more serious\" had happened because the foundations had moved. \"We can see at the base of the columns that the wall and the beams have moved,\" he said. \"That's caused stress throughout the structure, given the shape of the structure it's very top heavy, it's leaning on one side towards the pitch. \"So if there's some problems with the foundation, the natural reaction of the whole structure is to try to topple over onto the pitch.\" On Wednesday, the IFA's chief executive Patrick Nelson said staging the international at Windsor Park remained its \"only focus\". He said an alternative venue for the qualifier, such as the Kingspan Stadium, had not yet been considered. It is believed that at least two independent reports are being carried out on the damaged stand, with cracks first spotted on 31 March, two days after Northern Ireland's Euro 2016 qualifier against Finland. Linfield are unable to use their home venue and the Irish Cup final on 2 May, which was scheduled to be played at Windsor Park, has been switched to the Oval.\n",

            "Input: summarize: But it leaves the issue at the heart of the dispute unresolved: could the FBI have forced Apple to help it unlock the device? It is unlikely that this will be the last time a law enforcement agency tries to compel a tech company to help bypass security measures. It had been reported that there were about a dozen other cases in which the US Justice Department was pursuing court orders to force Apple to help its investigators. The highest profile of these was in Brooklyn, New York, where the FBI wanted access to an iPhone belonging to a defendant who had already pleaded guilty to drug dealing. In that case, a federal judge had rejected the DoJ's effort to invoke the All Writs Act - a three-centuries-old statute that allows court orders to be issued in circumstances where other laws don't apply. The DoJ had launched an appeal, but it is not yet clear if it will continue or drop it. Its decision may be based on whether the technique used to extract data from Farook's handset can be used in other cases. The New York case involved an iPhone 5S running the iOS 7 operating system, while the San Bernardino, California case was about an iPhone 5C running the more modern iOS 9. What works against one device might not work against the other. But assuming the US government will at some point try again to use the All Writs Act to force Apple or some other tech company to circumvent its data protection measures, it may take a Supreme Court ruling to determine whether this is truly within the authorities' power. At this point, there is nothing to compel the FBI to reveal how it was done, although Apple is likely to be pressing hard to find out. The tech firm's lawyers have already said they would want details of the technique to be made public if evidence from the cracked iPhone is later used at trial. But it could remain secret. There is scope within US law for the authorities to withhold the source of information if it was supplied to them on a confidential basis, and to protect sensitive intelligence-gathering methodologies. Not necessarily. The court order originally obtained by the FBI had instructed Apple to come up with a special version of its operating system that would have prevented Farook's iPhone from deleting its data or imposing long lockout periods if too many incorrect passcode guesses\n",

Ocado chief executive Tim Steiner said it had achieved \"robust trading\" in a challenging environment. However, the average order size fell 2.7% to £108.10 against the backdrop of continuing supermarket price wars. The rise of German competitors Aldi and Lidl has shaken up the sector, putting pressure on the big four supermarkets, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons. But investors welcomed Ocado's latest results, sending its share price up by more than 7% to 262p in morning trading. Annual revenues rose 14.8% to £1.27bn, and the retailer's customer base grew by almost 14% over the year to 580,000. However, Ocado said it was still in continued talks with several international retailers in regards to a partnership using the Ocado Smart Platform. When it released its full-year results in February last year, Ocado said it was in \"advanced discussions with multiple potential international partners\" for the platform, adding it expected to sign \"multiple deals\" in the medium term. Analysts believe agreements with retailers in the US and western Europe are important in driving Ocado's share price. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: \"The group has long said it's making progress on deals with third parties, but there hasn't been much in the way of tangible progress recently. \"The appointment of Luke Jensen [from Sainsbury's] as head of Ocado's Smart Platform will raise hopes that the group can finally get someone to sign on the dotted line.\" However, Mr Salmon warned that \"following Amazon's entry into the market, competitive pressures are rising in its core business\". \"In this context, it's arguably more important than ever for the group to get something over the line.\" Last year, Morrisons agreed to supply groceries to Amazon customers in the UK under a new deal with the US online giant. Amazon's entry into the market was seen as escalating competition in the sector. In August 2016, Morrisons also built on its existing relationship with Ocado expanding its home delivery\n",

The prison's power and water supplies had now been restored, he said. Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar said the situation at the prison was normal and denied there had been any disorder. Human rights and opposition activists say the prisoners took guards hostage about a week ago as they tried to halt the transfer of several inmates to another facility where they believed they might be executed. Security forces reportedly surrounded the jail and twice failed to retake it by force. Sheikh Nawwaf, who is also a prominent tribal leader in central Syria, said he travelled to Hama Prison on Saturday afternoon. The inmates' demands focused on ensuring fair and speedy trials for those detained without trial, and the release of those held without charge, he added. Sheikh Nawwaf said he had presented the demands to Mr Shaar and Justice Minister Najm Hamad al-Ahmed in Hama on Sunday. He said a deal to end the mutiny was reached later that day and included a promise from the government of fair trials for political detainees. Leading rights activist Mazen Darwish, who is in touch with the prisoners, confirmed that a verbal agreement had been reached, but did not give any details. Another activist told Reuters news agency the government had \"agreed to most of our demands to release those political detainees held without charge\". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict in Syria, reported that 26 detainees would be released soon.

Up to 30% of plastic released into the oceans each year comes from primary microplastics, not the disintegration of larger pieces, a report found. Debris from tyre abrasion and synthetic fabrics are the main sources, they say. The IUCN reviewed data from seven global regions to look at how much of the estimated 9.5 million tonnes of new plastic waste released into the oceans each year comes from primary microplastics. These are tiny plastic particles from the likes of consumer products rather than the degradation of larger bits of plastic in the oceans. The report found between 15% and 31% of plastic pollution came from primary microplastics, of which the biggest contributors (almost two-thirds) were abrasion of synthetic textiles, while washing, and abrasion of tyres, while driving. Synthetic rubber, made from a variant of plastic, makes up around 60% of the rubber used in tyres. Other sources included microbeads in cosmetics, which contributed about 2% of the releases to the ocean globally. Franois Simard, deputy director of IUCN's marine programme, said the findings came as a surprise. \"We discovered that most of the microplastics are coming from either the clothes or from the tyres,\" he told BBC News. \"Microplastics are going everywhere in the sea and into the food chain, let's close the plastic tap.\" IUCN director general Inger Andersen said the report was \"a real eye-opener\". \"Our daily activities, such as washing clothes and driving, significantly contribute to the pollution choking our oceans, with potentially disastrous effects on the rich diversity of life within them, and on human health,\" she said. The release of microbeads from cosmetic products has received widespread publicity, resulting in action from manufacturers. However, solving plastic pollution from tyres and synthetic clothes will be harder to address.

The 53-year-old, who was from Glasgow, was released from prison in September 2014 but was sought by police in April for breaching the terms of his licence. Police described him at the time as \"potentially dangerous\". His death was being treated as unexplained. Hamilton was nicknamed the Blackhill Butcher, after the Glasgow housing estate from which he operated. He had been on the police's most-wanted list before he was jailed in 2000 over a string of charges including drug dealing, torture, abduction and sodomy. Hamilton was sentenced to a minimum of nine years in prison after being found guilty at the High Court in Inverness. The case was moved 200 miles from Glasgow amid fears that witnesses could be intimidated. Hamilton had evaded justice on 12 previous occasions when witnesses were too terrified to testify. In court, a sickening picture emerged of how Hamilton, also known as the Fat Controller, entrapped young men with offers of drugs. Two young drug addicts were imprisoned in a Glasgow flat, stabbed through the cheek and had boiling water poured over them. Another attack in Edinburgh included an attempt to cut off a victim's finger. Passing sentence, judge Lord Kingarth said: \"You showed yourself capable of taking sadistic pleasure in the infliction of pain and the inspiration of real terror over long periods.

Ms Hawkins, a shoe machinist, helped lead the Suffragette campaign in Leicester and gave speeches in London. Her grandson said the statue would be in recognition of all the women who fought for universal suffrage. The anonymous donor had originally pledged some of the funds needed for the artwork but was moved to donate the full amount after watching the film Suffragette. Ms Hawkins' grandson, Peter Barratt, said the donor had \"made dreams and ambitions come true\". \"The statue will feature Alice but it is in recognition of all the women in the Leicester Suffragette movement 100 years ago, to gain a basic human right that that we all have today.\" Ms Hawkins left school in Stafford in 1876 to start work as a shoe machinist, later joining Equity Shoes, which encouraged workers to take part in political activism. From there she joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and was one of 18 women to be jailed when they were charged by mounted police in Hyde Park in February 1907. After her time in prison, she organised meetings and protests in Leicester, inviting Sylvia Pankhurst and helping form the city's section of the WSPU. She died in 1946, aged 83, and was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave. Mr Barratt said he was now inviting ideas from artists for the statue and hoped it would be put up in about 18 months' time.\n",

However, a National Audit Office report warned it must first find £5.8bn in new savings to meet the extra commitments. Defence minister Harriett Baldwin said it was delivering an affordable plan. The government set out its Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) in November 2015, announcing £12bn in extra defence spending. The review included plans for nine Boeing P8 maritime patrol aircraft - to replace the RAF's scrapped Nimrod jets - and that the purchase of 24 new F35 fighter aircraft would be accelerated. The NAO report said additional planned expenditure amounted to £24.4bn of new commitments to the MoD budget. The projected cost of funding the plan increased to £178bn - a rise of 7% - it said. 4,500 miles (7,200 km) maximum range without refuelling 490 knots (910km/h; 560mph) maximum speed 28 P-8A Poseidon aircraft in use by the United States 2 other countries, India and Australia, have variants of the aircraft in use or on order The review said the MoD was already having to use a £10bn contingency fund set aside for emergencies and will have to find another £5.8bn in savings over the next 10 years. The report warned the MoD had yet to generate £2.5bn of the £7.1bn savings already factored into the plan. However, head of the NAO, Sir Amyas Morse, said the affordability of the equipment plan \"is at greater risk than at any time since its inception\". \"It is worrying to see that the costs of the new commitments arising from the review considerably exceed the net increase in funding for the plan. \"There is little room for unplanned cost growth and the MoD must actively guard against the risk of a return to previous practice where affordability could only be maintained by delaying or reducing the scope of projects.\" The spending plans have also been hit by recent currency fluctuations as the MoD looks to buy new equipment from the US.

            "Input: summarize: It had been thought that being unhappy was bad for health - particularly for the heart. But the decade-long analysis, published in the Lancet, said previous studies had just confused cause and effect. However, experts argued that unhappiness in childhood may still have a lasting impact. A series of studies had shown that how happy people are, strongly predicts how long they are going to live. Ideas included detrimental changes in stress hormones or the immune system resulting in a higher risk of death. But the research team in the UK and Australia said those studies failed to deal with reverse causality - namely, that people who are ill are not very happy. Participants in the Million Women Study were asked to regularly rate their health, happiness and levels of stress. The results showed that whether people were \"never\", \"usually\" or \"mostly\" happy had no impact on their odds of dying during the duration of the study once other factors such as health or whether they smoked were taken into account. Dr Bette Liu, one of the researchers at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: \"Illness makes you unhappy, but unhappiness itself doesn't make you ill. \"We found no direct effect of unhappiness or stress on mortality, even in a 10-year study of a million women.\" Co-author Prof Sir Richard Peto, from the University of Oxford, said light smokers had double the risk of an early death and regular smokers had three times the risk of dying during the study period, but that happiness was \"irrelevant\". He said it could have indirect effects if people started consuming large amounts of alcohol or massively overeating, but happiness itself \"does not have any material, direct, effect on mortality\". But he warned the myth may be too entrenched to shake off: \"People will still believe stress causes heart attacks after this story has been and gone. \"It isn't true, but it suits people to believe it.\" In a commentary, Dr Philipe de Souto Barreto and professor Yves Rolland from the University Hospital of Toulouse in France, said: \"Further research from a lifecourse perspective is needed since happiness during critical periods, such as childhood, could have important consequences on health in adulthood.\"\n",

But Rosberg said: \"It is all ready to go. It just needs to be put on the car. \"For sure we all want it to be put on the car as soon as possible. I am disappointed and we'll look into that.\" Some drivers believe it was the right decision to postpone the introduction of the halo. Media playback is not supported on this device Renault's Jolyon Palmer said: \"F1 safety is very good at the moment. We have very big run offs, I am pretty happy with the safety levels we have at the moment. \"It is personal preference, I know a lot of the drivers, especially the younger ones, are in the same camp as me.\" But Rosberg said: \"The large majority of drivers agree we need to get it on the car as soon as possible. It makes sense. \"It is such a huge step for safety.\" The Grand Prix Drivers' Association [GPDA] has been vocal in pushing for the introduction of the halo and on Thursday its chairman, former F1 driver Alexander Wurz, said he \"hoped F1 does not come to regret the decision\". Wurz added that it \"could almost be seen as 'business first and safety second'\". Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel, a director of the GPDA, said: \"I haven't read exactly what the reasoning was. It still remains positive that from 2018 onwards it is going to be on the car.\" The decision to postpone the introduction of the halo caught some team insiders by surprise as all had been given the impression so far this year by the FIA, motorsport's world governing body, that it was working towards introducing the device in 2017. F1 race director Charlie Whiting said the main reason for the delay was to give more time for drivers to assess its impact. Whiting said: \"The decision was taken that simply because only three drivers have ever tried it, and they have only done a total of four laps. \"This was something that everyone felt was quite a relevant thing and it wouldn't really be feasible to expect, in the short term, to get the relevant number of laps with\n",

More than 40kg (88lb) of wool was removed in what the RSPCA says is the heaviest wool haul from one shearing. National shearing champion Ian Elkins was urgently called in on Wednesday to tackle the mammoth merino. Mr Elkins described Thursday's marathon sheering session as one of his biggest challenges, saying he had never seen anything like it in 35 years of work. Chris the sheep had to be sedated during the very delicate operation. Mr Elkins said he was proud Australia had claimed the title from New Zealand, likening it to \"the rivalry on the rugby field\". The massive bundle of fleece tipped the scales at more than 42kg (92lb), but was revised down to 40kg (88lb) to counter the weight of the bag. Animal welfare officials said Chris was \"four-to-five times its normal size\" before going under the knife. In 2004, Shrek the New Zealand sheep was found after six years on the loose. The animal - also a merino - later lost his giant 27kg (60lb) fleece in a televised shearing broadcast live around the world.\n",

Aadhaar, which means foundation, started out as a voluntary programme to help tackle benefit fraud. However, it has become increasingly critical for any financial transactions and for access to welfare schemes. States have been using Aadhaar to transfer government pensions, scholarships, wages for a landmark rural jobs-for-work scheme and benefits for cooking fuel to targeted recipients, and distribute cheap food to the poor. The government argues that Aadhaar has cut waste, removed fakes, curbed corruption and made substantial savings. But questions have been raised about the moral authority of the government to force citizens to share biometric data. Activists say it is in breach of the UN's Fundamental Right of Privacy.\n",

Ranger then got a brilliant opener for Southend in the 35th minute, shuffling past three players and prodding a shot into the right-hand corner while off balance to score his third goal in as many games. The Dons had been wasteful in possession but Lyle Taylor nearly latched onto Tom Soares' through-ball just before half-time. Simon Cox doubled Southend's lead shortly after the hour mark after taking advantage of a fortunate rebound in midfield and lashing past Shea from 20 yards.

Users with Apple TV, Amazon's Fire TV and Samsung's Smart TVs will be able to watch Facebook's user-generated videos directly on their televisions. The announcement is in line with Facebook's increasing focus on video. The company has recently been paying creators for exclusive premium video content, and is heavily promoting the Facebook Live feature that allows users to live stream events. Facebook says the standalone app will be released \"soon\". The only screen Facebook doesn't dominate right now is the biggest one in your home. The company's decision to launch these TV apps - which we've been expecting for some time now - is the first significant step the company has made to build its challenge to the likes of Netflix and Hulu. To do that, though, it will need to offer programmes that are of a far higher quality than what is on Facebook right now. That will require big investment in getting top talent to make Facebook-only video. One interesting move will be how it plans to make money from TV. If Facebook feels it can make its content free (with income coming from advertising), then it could give subscriber services like Netflix and Amazon Prime serious pause for thought. The announcement by the social media giant was made together with several other news about the company's video features. Videos will now autoplay sound in the news feed and will be displayed in full, even if they are vertical.\n",

The 44-year-old has joined Rovers on a two-year contract. Chief executive Eric Drysdale said: \"Ray ticks all the boxes and we are confident he can take us forward.\" Rovers were seeking a new manager after Grant Murray, who had been in charge for three years, was sacked in April following five straight defeats. Now Malpas, the 52-year-old former Motherwell and Swindon Town manager who had been in his role since December, has also left the Kirkcaldy club. \"As promised, the board has taken great care in its search for someone to replace Grant Murray,\" said Drysdale. \"We spoke in detail to four of the very best candidates from a very long list of applicants. \"Only one, Ray, was formally offered the job and we are very pleased that he has accepted.\" Former Rovers player McKinnon, who previously managed junior club Lochee United, recently signed a new contract at Glebe Park. First-team coach Laurie Ellis took charge of the Kirkcaldy side for the final Scottish Championship match of the season - a 2-2 draw away to Dumbarton - as they finished in sixth place. McKinnon, who took over as Brechin boss in 2012, led his side to a fourth-place finish in League One this season. However, they missed out on promotion after losing 2-1 on aggregate to Alloa Athletic in their play-off semi-final. McKinnon, who began his career at Tannadice, had two spells as a player at Stark's Park. He made five appearances in 2000 after leaving Livingston before joining Portadown, and Rovers were his final senior club, making 12 appearances in 2003 after leaving Montrose.

But the wilderness of the non-league scene is exactly where the lifelong association between Flynn and Newport begun. Given a reprieve by manager Tim Harris and a chance with the first team after his youth team axing, Flynn also found employment as a postman. Thanks to his form with the Exiles, a nickname earned rather than chosen after years spent out of the city as a reformed club without a home, Flynn impressed as a midfielder with an eye for goal. In the non-league pyramid at least, this postman did always deliver. A switch to full time football was the dream, achieved with a transfer to Barry Town, a move that changed the course of Flynn's life. There was to be no future in shelf stacking or letter delivering for Flynn after joining the full time Welsh Premier League side, as he went on to make over 400 Football League appearances for the likes of Gillingham, Wigan and Bradford City. He returned to his first club and first love Newport County five years ago, helping to steer them to a promotion 25 years in the making. Flynn was 'heartbroken' when the club released him as Terry Butcher axed 11 players, after Newport's millionaire chairman Les Scadding opted to walk away from the club. He soon returned when the Supporters' Trust succeeded Scadding, working in various roles including as a club ambassador, in marketing, and as a first team coach. He even found time to get in a few games for Welsh League third-tier side Undy, so it was no surprise this season when Flynn came out of retirement to help the beleaguered Exiles. Flynn's career at County, and in football, was almost over before it started. \"I got kicked out of the youth team.

Builders also hired more workers and ordered more supplies to deal with an increase in new projects. Economists said the sector was recovering after a slow start to 2017. \"A sustained rebound in residential building provides an encouraging sign that the recent a soft patch for property values has not deterred new housing supply,\" said Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit. \"Instead, strong labour market conditions, resilient demand and ultra-low mortgage rates appear to have helped boost work on residential development projects.\" The data contrasts with reports earlier this week suggesting greater caution by homebuyers and lenders. Building society Nationwide said house prices had fallen for a third consecutive in May - the longest run of decline since 2009, just after the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the Bank of England said loan approvals fell to a seven-month low in April. The latest Markit/CIPS construction reading was still much weaker than the post-crisis high of 64.6 seen in January 2014. However, the survey found there had been solid rises across the whole sector in May, including in civil engineering and commercial building. Input prices for construction firms also rose at the slowest pace for seven months, despite the prolonged weakness of the pound. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result suggested the Brexit vote's \"dampening influence on construction activity is fading\". But he added: \"Note, however, that the PMI has had to exceed 53 in the past to signal growth. \"May's PMI reading, therefore, is consistent with quarter-on-quarter growth in construction output of only about 0.5%.\"\n",

The details emerged as John was struck off by a panel, which heard one of his victims felt \"degraded and scared\". Essex Police said John was still wanted by officers. John, then a doctor at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, took covert videos of women, without their knowledge, at The Harvey Centre in April 2011. It is understood he used a bag containing a concealed camera. One victim told police: \"The incident has made me feel dirty and degraded. I feel like I can't wear a skirt anymore and I am going to be scared every time I see a man with a bag. \"I feel violated as if he has actually touched me inappropriately. At this moment in time I am very upset and shocked.\" Chelmsford magistrates released John on bail to be sentenced in May 2011, by which time he had already left the UK. The panel heard he then phoned his colleague Jeffrey Philips, a consultant in intensive care. \"He understood that Dr John had flown out on the day of the Royal wedding, which took place on 29 April 2011, in the belief that the airport would be quiet,\" the panel heard. Police broke down the door of his rented flat in Dads Wood, Harlow, a week later and found food in the fridge that was weeks out of date. Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service said it had served notice about its hearing to John's parents in India. In reaching its decision, the panel said: \"Public confidence in the medical profession would be seriously undermined if Dr John was not erased from the medical register after indicating a guilty plea to an offence related to his actions in filming beneath women's skirts, and then fleeing the country prior to sentencing. It added: \"Ms A [the victim] had been caused significant and understandable distress. \"In addition, it considered that the public would also regard Dr John's action in absconding before sentencing to be wholly reprehensible and unbecoming of a doctor.

It said failure to do this would have a severe impact on migrants' rights. Ministers say they expect this to happen but need equivalent guarantees for UK citizens on the Continent. The question of what will happen to the estimated 2.9 million citizens of other EU countries who have made their home in the UK in recent years is one of the most controversial arising from the UK's vote to leave the EU in June's referendum. The government has said it expects an early resolution of the issue once official talks on the terms of the UK's separation from the EU begin next spring. But it has refrained from giving any guarantees on their future status - saying this is impossible without similar safeguards for the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in Spain, France, Italy and other EU countries. But the Lords EU Justice sub-committee said the UK should not wait to hear from other EU countries and that making a binding commitment now was \"morally the right thing to do\". If this was not possible before Article 50 is triggered, expected before the end of March, the peers said the issue should be negotiated separately from other matters to ensure a \"preliminary\" agreement as quickly as possible. Without any agreement, it said EU nationals living in the UK would be subject to \"Byzantine\" national immigration laws and many would be unable to meet the criteria for permanent residency despite having been here for more than five years. \"The government is under a moral obligation to give a unilateral declaration immediately to safeguard the EU citizenship rights of all EU nationals in the UK when the UK withdraws from the EU,\" said Baroness Kennedy QC, the Labour peer who chairs the cross-party committee. \"I also believe that such a gesture will stimulate reciprocal commitments from the other EU countries where UK citizens are currently living. \"For the last six months, the lives of EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU have been shrouded in anxiety. \"Their rights to live, work and reside in their country of choice are now so unclear that people have no idea how, or even where, they should plan their futures.\" The government has said it wants to limit the currently unconditional right of EU citizens\n",

The wheelchair-bound 105-year-old said: \"I think it's a wonderful honour to have the building named after me. \"I hope the school will make contact with a school in the Czech Republic that is also named after me.\" Other guests included Home Secretary Theresa May, MP for Maidenhead. The school was proposed in February 2012 and then approved by the Department for Education through the free schools programme in June 2012. Once it reaches capacity, the school will have 500 pupils, including 225 boarders aged 11-19 years. Parents pay £3,850 a term for boarders but daytime education is free. Free schools, which anyone can apply to set up, are funded directly by central government and are free from local council control.\n",

Sales also rose 20% to $23.2bn in the second quarter to the end of June, boosted by strong growth in the US. Its shares, which fell 1.3% during the day, leapt 18.5% to $571.24 a share in after-hours trading on Wall Street. The firm was also upbeat on its prospects for the current third quarter, forecasting sales would grow between 13% and 24% compared to last year, much higher than analysts had predicted. Sales in North America rose 25.5% to $13.8bn in the second quarter, driven by purchases of electronic goods and general merchandise, helping to drive the strong performance. Its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, also made a contribution, with sales up 81% compared to the same quarter last year. It said its widely promoted \"Prime Day\" on 15th July - which offered special deals to customers who signed up to its fast delivery service - had been a success with more new members trying it globally than any other day in the firm's history. Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos credited hard work for the results: \"The teams at Amazon have been working hard for customers,\" he said. Throughout its history, Amazon's revenue has climbed while its profit has hovered around or below zero. On Thursday evening, the e-commerce company reported a profit. As customers in North America bought electronics and others products, sales in its biggest market rose more than 25% compared to last year. And if you thought Microsoft's cloud computing business did well, then take a look at Amazon web services which includes its cloud business - revenue soared more than 80 percent. The only slight negative was that sales growth outside the US wasn't nearly as impressive. Still after years of ploughing its cash into new technology, mostly aimed at making it easier and faster for customers to get what they want, the results are starting to pay off - at least in the eyes of Wall Street\n",

The Premiership leaders took a first-half lead thanks to Stuart Armstrong's well-taken goal.

Chris Fraser, of Sirius, said its case stood \"up to scrutiny\" and it was determined to pursue the plan. The North York Moors National Park Authority is to consider a planning application on 30 June. The 229-page report by the park authority does not make any recommendation about the proposed mine. It acknowledged that there were likely to be economic benefits but said the proposal did not represent \"exceptional circumstances\". The report said the National Park Authority's statutory responsibility was to \"conserve and enhance the North York Moors for the enjoyment of present and future generations\". Sirius said it believed exceptional circumstances had been demonstrated and the mining was in the public interest, with environmental effects \"mitigated\". The term \"potash\" is used to describe a range of minerals containing potassium, and the proposal is to mine polyhalite. The mine would transform North Yorkshire's economy, Ryedale District Council and Scarborough Borough Council has claimed. However a report published earlier this month suggested that the five-year construction phase of the mine would cost the area's tourism industry £10m a year. The Campaign for National Parks said it hoped the authority would reject the planning application. The decision was an \"important test of the protection afforded national parks\" and there were strong planning grounds for turning it down, it added. Plans include a construction of a minehead at Dove's Nest Farm and Haxby Plantation about 1.6 miles (2.5km) from the village of Sneaton involving mining shafts, buildings, roads and a helicopter landing site on a 64-hectare site.\n",

In a change from the current knock-out format, there will be 16 regional groups of four for the opening round. The proposals were approved at the English Football League's annual general meeting in Portugal this week. Since the decision was announced Portsmouth, Accrington Stanley, AFC Wimbledon, Hartlepool United and Luton Town have released statements to confirm they voted against the trial. EFL clubs approve academy 'Rooney Rule' In a statement, the EFL said it was piloting the changes as part of their \"ongoing commitment to creating more and better home grown players\". The changes will see the 16 academy sides evenly distributed throughout the groups alongside the League One and League Two clubs, with the competition continuing to run on a north/south basis until the final. Each team will play each other once in the group stage, with the academy team getting just one home game. The knockout stages will be single ties apart from the semi-finals, where there will be two legs. At the AGM, clubs approved a 'Rooney Rule'-style application process to try to improve the number of black and ethnic minority coaches in the game. They also discussed the EFL's proposals to add a new division of 20 teams to the English pyramid - meaning that there would be 100 teams in a five-division structure, rather than the current set-up of 92 clubs across four tiers.

Smoke could be seen billowing from shops on the outskirts of the market on Thursday, as dozens of fire engines tackled the flames. The fire was out by Thursday night and there were no reports of injuries. Tsukiji's interior industrial market - where the famous tuna auctions take place - was undamaged and the area was open to tourists as usual. The blaze broke out at about 16:50 local time (07:50 GMT), Japanese broadcaster NHK said, in the outer region of the market and close to the surrounding area's narrow streets. The area is home to many sushi restaurants and shops, some of which have been evacuated, NHK reports. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The blaze seems to have affected several old wooden buildings. The market was constructed in 1935, in the aftermath of the great Kanto earthquake of 1923, and built largely from corrugated iron sheds. Today, it is a sprawling, busy market, but is seen by many as rundown and overcrowded. Nonetheless, its enormous volume and variety of produce means it receives tens of thousands of tourist visitors each year. The market is due to be moved by the end of 2017. Efforts to move the market to a more modern location have been met with resistance by many of the workers, some of whom have been in the family business for generations. Tokyo's governor, Yuriko Koike, has previously said the market needs to be rebuilt because of its age - and the associated risk of it being vulnerable to earthquakes, which are not uncommon in Japan.\n",

It comes two years after a parliamentary commission proposed a shake-up of the UK banking industry in the wake of the financial crisis. The regime will take effect from March. The new rules follow a public outcry after a series of scandals in the industry, including Libor rigging and foreign exchange rate fixing. The Chancellor George Osborne said in his annual Mansion House speech last month: \"The public rightly asks why it is that after so many scandals, and such cost to the country, so few individuals have faced punishment in the courts.\" The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said at the same event that the \"age of irresponsibility\" was over as he set out new plans for jail terms for rogue bankers and traders who manipulate markets to be lengthened from seven to 10 years. Earlier today, the former UBS and Citigroup trader Tom Hayes, who is accused of manipulating the Libor rate, told a court at his trial that senior managers knew what he was doing. \"I acted with complete transparency... My managers knew, my manager's manager knew. In some cases the CEO [chief executive] was aware of it,\" he said. Mr Hayes is the first person to be prosecuted over the Libor scandal which cost Barclays Bank a then record £290m in 2012 before Royal Bank of Scotland £390m for its part in the scandal. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) - part of the Bank of England - said their new rules would place the \"burden of proof\" on top banking executives in incidents of wrongdoing within their companies. The rules replace existing arrangements that require regulators to prove senior executives were responsible for wrongdoing. FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley said: \"Today we have given clarity on rules that will embed personal accountability into the culture of the City.

Colin Ackermann hit a six off the final ball as Leicestershire edged out Lancashire in a thrilling finish. Surrey beat Somerset despite a 12-run over-rate penalty and there were also wins for holders Northants and Kent. A total of 66 sixes were struck in Sunday's five games, 19 of them in the Sussex v Glamorgan game. While South Africa's Test team crashed to a 211-run defeat against England at Lord's, it was a good day for some of their compatriots on the county circuit - especially those playing for Glamorgan. Chief among them was Ingram, who hit seven sixes to rescue his side from 7-2. He added 130 with former Proteas batsman Jacques Rudolph (49) and then 70 off the final six overs with Johannesburg-born Chris Cooke (37 not out) as they posted 198-3. When it was Glamorgan's turn to field, Ingram weighed in with the wickets of Ross Taylor and Ben Brown. And although Wright equalled Ingram's sixes tally in his 101 off 53 balls, he fell to another South African, Marchant de Lange, in the penultimate over as they came up short on 180-6. At Aigburth, Liam Livingstone (48 off 34 balls) and Jos Buttler (39 off 21) were the main contributors to Lancashire Lightning's 173-9.

This year was the first time in the 55-year history of the awards that women have secured the top honour in all four categories. The recipients were great Australians and great role models, said chairman of the National Australia Day Council, Ben Roberts-Smith. \"It is a great moment in the 55-year history of these awards to honour four women. \"Rosie, Jackie, Drisana and Juliette remind us of the many ways in which women contribute to our nation; that women are a force for change, a voice for rights, influencers, educators and the heart of our communities,\" he said. After her son's death, UK-born Ms Batty emerged as an articulate and powerful advocate for the rights of women and children living in violent relationships, giving new force to efforts to prevent family violence across Australia.

Typhoo Tea produces 125 million tea bags a week at its factory in Moreton, Wirral, which have just one ingredient - tea leaves, and they are imported. Black tea is a global commodity, traded in dollars. Following the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote, costs have soared for this renowned brand as 95% of its sales are in the UK. \"This is an absolute disaster for a company the size of ours,\" says Mr Saha. \"The very sharp fall in the pound means the impact is at least a quarter of a million pounds a month for us. This is having a very negative impact on our business and we are really suffering. It's now come to a point where it's not sustainable for us.\" The news comes amid warnings of rising prices in the grocery sector, and with supermarket chain Morrisons increasing the cost of a jar of Marmite by 12.5%. There are plenty of winners from the fall in the value of sterling. But Typhoo Tea is a graphic illustration of what it's like for a business with one raw imported material. Typhoo has been trading for more than a century. These days, most of its black tea comes from Kenya. It's then blended and packaged on site. The company also packages own-label tea for most of the major supermarkets. In addition, it produces a range of herbal teas and those ingredients are sourced in euros. It's a high-volume, low-margin business. The cost of the ingredient depends on the quality of the leaf. A typical 80kg bag of black tea could be bought for £90 to £100 at the beginning of the year. The company says that same bag now costs £120 to £150 at the weekly international auctions. In other words, it is paying an awful lot more for the same amount of tea. \"We don't have big enough margins between us and retailers to absorb all these costs. We're looking at how to mitigate some of them, from our labour, overheads and marketing costs, which will affect the growth of the business and employment in long run. But some of these currency costs will have to be passed on, as neither us nor the retailers can absorb any more cost\n",

They have been asked to sign the letter acknowledging the terms and return it to the authority's legal department. It comes after the council became the first in Scotland to issue bonds on the stock exchange worth £370m. That followed credit rating agency Moody's assigning Aberdeen an Aa2 rating. It will be used to fund infrastructure projects including the new Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre (AECC) and the City Centre Masterplan. The local authority said the bonds were less expensive than other available loans. BBC Scotland understands that some councillors were initially concerned about the terms of the letter and whether it would impact on their ability to raise concerns publicly about the council's finances. Insider dealing - where a person uses inside financial information to their benefit - is a criminal offence and is punishable by a heavy fine or imprisonment. Market abuse is when someone can be given an unlimited fine for disclosing financial information that might affect the value of bonds and investments. As well as councillors, senior officials at Aberdeen City Council are also included in the insiders list that must be disclosed to the Financial Conduct Authority on request.

Moses Odubajo forced another save from Heaton at the start of the second half. Tigers keeper Allan McGregor spilled Joey Barton's shot to Sam Vokes and he kept his cool to slot home the rebound. The result meant the third-placed Clarets are one point behind both the Tigers and Middlesbrough, but have played more games than both.

Barton came close to opening the scoring after half an hour when his skidding free-kick forced a low save from McGregor before the keeper denied the same player from a header. The pivotal moment in the game came in the 77th minute when Wales international Vokes reacted quickest to McGregor's save from another Barton effort. Hull substitute Chuba Akpom had a shot saved but he could not prevent his side suffering a first defeat since 28 December.

The filing states Yelchin left behind at least $641,000 (£486,000) in personal property and had $731,000 (£554,000) in equity in his home.

They are expected to announce their intentions to file the suit at a press conference on Tuesday. In April, the company recalled 1.1m vehicles worldwide over the risk they could roll away after drivers exit. The vehicle that killed Yelchin, who was 27 years old, was one of those subject to a recall because the gear shifters confused drivers, causing the vehicles to roll away unexpectedly. Fiat Chrysler offered their sympathies to Yelchin's family in a statement, but said it could not comment on their plans for a lawsuit. The company added it was speeding up its recall of the vehicle.

Mr Comey announced last week that the investigation had turned up fresh emails relating to Hillary Clinton. Mr Weiner is married to Mrs Clinton's political aide Huma Abedin. In an open letter, the teenager said reporters had \"canvassed\" her area. \"Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my'story'\", she wrote. \"Why couldn't your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the centre of attention the last week of the election cycle?\" She accused the FBI director of taking a \"vague approach\" in announcing that emails had been discovered on Mr Weiner's laptop that related to Mrs Clinton. She said the lack of detail in his announcement led reporters to chase her for clues about what might have been found.

The action sequences are huge, the soundtrack is awesome, and the people are ludicrously good looking. But it's also just totally ridiculous, which may not surprise those who have seen the trailer. Or read the somewhat less-than-kind reviews. Dwayne Johnson - the highest paid (and most annoyingly likeable) movie star in the world - takes the lead in the reboot as Mitch alongside Zac Efron, who plays Brody. Kelly Rohrbach, Alexandra Daddario and Priyanka Chopra also star, and there are, most importantly, cameo appearances from David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. (I would've thought they'd want to keep those as a surprise, personally, but their names appear in giant letters at the beginning alongside the rest of the cast.) But this incarnation of Baywatch is much more knowing and tongue-in-cheek than it was in Hasselhoff and Anderson's day. The film itself is long - presumably to allow for the slow-motion button to be used to its full potential when any character is running down the shoreline. Those who lived through the TV show will remember the appeal of such bouncy scenes, which were a key part of helping the series become a worldwide phenomenon. And a phenomenon it was. Baywatch became the most-watched television show in the world at the time and represented a huge cultural shift. Anderson was the embodiment of a look which rose to prominence in the 90s - skinny, blonde, and enhanced by plastic surgery. But strangely, the show arguably also had a moral compass, which may help explain why it got its early evening slot on TV. The lifeguards were portrayed as something of a family, working as a cohesive team and looking out for each other while saving lives. A lot of the storylines felt wholesome and saw characters doing the \"right thing\" - an odd juxtaposition with the highly sexualised elements of the series. Mitch's relationship with his son is a good example - Hasselhoff's character is seen as a model single father to Hobie, doing his best to raise him with good\n",

Dumbarton's Craig Barr hit the crossbar with a second-half header but the Sons then had Andy Dowie sent off for two bookings. Substitutes Nicky Clark and Andy Ryan added late goals to add gloss to the visitors' victory. That is four wins on the bounce for Allan Johnston's men and on this form Dunfermline appear to be more than capable of sustaining a promotion challenge. Of the six players playing in midfield or attack, only Nate Wedderburn really sits back. That security allowed Cardle, Higginbotham, Declan McManus, Dean Shiels and Callum Smith to roam forward in the first half. Cardle converted at the back post after a messy scramble following good initial play down the right by McManus. A superb counter-attack brought the Pars their second, as Higginbotham rolled the ball calmly into the far corner from a fairly tight angle. Dumbarton nearly reduced the deficit, but Barr's header bounced off the woodwork after he had connected with Tom Walsh's corner. The Sons also felt aggrieved not to be given a penalty when Ally Roy appeared to be clipped just inside the box. Dowie was given his marching orders with 15 minutes to go, before Clark made his comeback from an ankle injury to head in David Hopkirk's cross. Clark then back-heeled to tee up another substitute Ryan for a well-executed, low curled shot into the far left corner. Dunfermline manager Allan Johnston: \"I'm happy but I'm realistic as well because we know it's only the start of the season.

The Local Government Association said it was the result of \"historic under-funding\" and an ageing population. The government declined an interview but said English councils had received £9.25bn for social care. The figure for the number of cancelled contracts comes from a Freedom of Information request, which was responded to by 197 of 212 UK councils. According to the research, carried out for Panorama by Opus Restructuring and Company Watch, 69 home care companies have closed in the last three months and one in four of the UK's 2,500 home care companies is at risk of insolvency. Councillor Izzi Seccombe from the Local Government Association - which represents councils across England and Wales - said: \"We have warned that the combination of the historic under-funding of adult social care, and the significant pressures of an ageing population and the national living wage, are pushing the care provider market to the brink of collapse. \"These figures show the enormous strain providers are under, and emphasises the urgent need for a long-term, sustainable solution to the social care funding crisis.\" Many home care companies say their biggest problem is recruitment and retention of carers. The Centre for Workforce Intelligence estimates at least two million more carers will be needed by 2025 in England alone, in both in-home care and care homes, to cope with growing demand. Last October, the regulator for England, the Care Quality Commission, warned that adult social care was at a tipping point.

Ken Hogg, at Cymorth Llaw, said: \"We didn't think we could do it for the money - it was as simple as that. \"We pay as much [in wages] as we possibly can and we've always paid above what was the national minimum wage and the national living wage. \"[Carers] get a mileage allowance, they get paid travelling time between their clients.\" Mr Hogg said the company was legally obliged to pay 1% pension\n",

The missile launched on Tuesday crossed Japan's northern Hokkaido island, triggering public alerts to take cover, before landing in the sea. The UN Security Council has unanimously condemned North Korea for its actions. Meeting late on Tuesday in New York, the council called the launch \"outrageous\", demanding North Korea cease all missile testing. While the statement said the regime's actions were a threat to all UN member states, it did not threaten new sanctions against Pyongyang. Russia and China said US military activity in the region was partly to blame for the increase in tensions, and urged negotiations. Arriving for a visit to Japan, British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday called on China to put more pressure on North Korea, saying that Beijing had a key role in the international response to Pyongyang's \"reckless provocation\". North Korea has repeatedly conducted missile launches in recent months, despite being barred from doing so under UN rules. The latest, a domestically made Hwasong-12, was launched early on Tuesday Korean time from a site near Pyongyang. It travelled some 2,700km (1,678 miles), at an unusually low height for North Korean missile tests, over Hokkaido before crashing about 1,180km off Japan's eastern coast. Japan sent out alerts telling people in Hokkaido to take cover. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe later called it \"unprecedented, serious and a grave threat\". For the first time, North Korea's official news agency KCNA admitted deliberately firing a ballistic missile across Japan. Previous projectiles which crossed the mainland were later claimed to have been satellite launches. It said the launch was in direct response to joint US-South Korean military drills which are currently taking place, as well as to mark the anniversary of the Japan-Korea treaty of 1910, which saw Japanese forces annex the Korean peninsula. KCNA, quoting leader Kim Jong-un, said that, \"like a real war\", the latest drill was \"the first step of the military operation of the KPA [Korean People's Army] in the Pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing Guam\".

Martin O'Neill's team had struck the woodwork and gone close several times prior to scoring. But, after taking the lead they found themselves under increasing pressure and conceded when Clark, chosen ahead of Richard Keogh in the centre of defence, headed a low cross from Zlatan Ibrahimovic into his own net. The equaliser came from one of the few moments of quality from the Sweden captain, who collected a neat backheel from substitute John Guidetti and raced to the byeline before drilling in a low cross. Jeff Hendrick drew a late save from Andreas Isaksson but there was to be no winner at the end of a feisty, scrappy match the Republic shaded but could not close out. Commitment, passion and determination were much in evidence at the Stade de France, with those workmanlike qualities comfortably eclipsing any quality and finesse on show. But, in the end, neither side had quite enough to prevail and are left to ponder a result that is hardly disastrous but not exactly what either wanted. Both have remaining Group E fixtures against Italy and Belgium - the two favourites to progress - and have arguably missed out on their best chance to get a crucial victory.

Mr Turnbull, the new prime minister, ousted Mr Abbott from power in an internal party challenge last month. On 26 January - Australia's national day - Mr Abbott announced he had nominated Queen Elizabeth II's husband to receive the knighthood. He had said then that the Duke of Edinburgh's life of \"service and dedication\" should be honoured. The Queen awarded the knighthood in April. Asked on Thursday in an interview with radio station 3AW about his decision, Mr Abbott said: \"Obviously it was an injudicious appointment.\" Australia's honours system The move was met with scorn from many among the Australian public, who questioned the Prince's contributions to Australia and pointed out that as a British royal he was a symbol of another country. Some media outlets called it a \"Knightmare\", opposition leader Bill Shorten called it \"anachronistic\", and Mr Abbott faced criticism from within his own Liberal party. Mr Turnbull, who used to chair Australia's republican movement, had previously defended the honours system's revival in 2014, noting that most republics have an honours system and an order of knighthood.

But between travel companies' elevated school holiday prices and the need to juggle work commitments, some parents say they cannot always go away during the school holidays and that it should be their decision to make. Hayley, 39, says she is \"fuming\" at the ruling. Together with her husband Martin, the couple, from Cheshire, took their children Archie, aged five, and Ruby, six, out of school in January to attend a family wedding in India. As Archie was under five at the time, his absence did not cause problems. But Ruby's did. Not long after they returned, letters arrived from the local council to inform them that they were being fined a total of £120. \"I'm not going to pay it,\" she said. \"They basically brandish you a criminal.\" Hayley had asked the school for permission but says she never received a reply. \"Why should you be dictated to?\" she said. \"It's made no difference to Ruby.

Hibernian's visit to Ibrox on 28 December was marred by sectarian chants from the home end, while there were complaints of sectarian songs during Celtic's Scottish Cup trip to Stranraer. Celtic and Dundee United have both condemned their own fans for setting off pyrotechnics. SPFL board member Mike Mulraney revealed there was not appetite to introduce new strict liability rules. The Alloa chairman said there is \"no chance whatsoever\" of clubs agreeing to regulations that could see them punished for the conduct of supporters regardless of whether the club itself is to blame.

The court has heard Ms Williams was obsessed by Mr Johnston, 57, and \"eliminated\" Ms Hartley with the help of Katrina Walsh, 56, who also denies murder, when he refused to leave her. Mr Johnston, who had been in an \"intermittent\", \"intimate\" relationship with communications director Ms Hartley, began a sexual relationship with Ms Williams after they met in December 2012. The former firefighter told Ms Williams the relationship was over months later, he said, but she kept contacting him in person or by text and even sent an anonymous letter to Ms Hartley, boasting the sender had had \"fantastic\" sex with Mr Johnston. John McDermott, prosecuting, said Mr Johnston and Ms Williams exchanged naked photographs on 3, 4 and 5 December last year.

Many teenagers on the programme have lived with domestic violence between parents so the project attempts to \"de-normalise\" abuse and help them move on to healthier relationships.

Plant expert Richard Lansdown said: \"We wouldn't normally reintroduce but Inglestone is down to a single plant.\" The species, more commonly known as the Badgeworth buttercup, relies on bare, wet ground that has been churned up by cattle to set seed and thrive. But with fewer animals grazing the common in recent years, it has become overrun with scrub and the buttercup now \"only grows intermittently\" at a single pond. \"I sieved out the mud and extracted all the seeds [at Inglestone] and didn't find any from the Badgeworth buttercup - there weren't any left at all,\" said Mr Lansdown. \"So we've had to use seed originally collected from the site some years ago that was sent to the Millennium Seed Bank.\" Using the 270 plus seeds held at Kew, 200 plants were propagated and about 80 planted out at Inglestone with a further planting planned for mid-June \"The two sites have been declining for a very, very long time,\" said Mr Lansdown. \"But we've planted out 83 plants in different locations at Inglestone and at least half of them are surviving and doing well and have begun fruiting which will add to the seed bank.\"\n",

A fragile peace deal signed last year is on the brink of collapse. \"The violence in July came as a major setback to peace efforts in South Sudan,\" the UNHCR spokesman Leo Dobbs said in a statement. The UN says more than 185,000 people have fled South Sudan since July. \"The fighting has shattered hopes for a real breakthrough and triggered new waves of displacement and suffering, while humanitarian organisations are finding it very difficult for logistical, security and funding reasons to provide urgent protection and assistance to the hundreds of thousands in need,\" Mr Dobbs said. South Sudan refugees: Many of the refugees arriving in Uganda, which hosts the most South Sudanese, are \"exhausted after days walking in the bush and going without food or water. Many children have lost one or both of their parents\", the UNHCR says. A fall-out between President Salva Kiir and former Vice-President Machar - the most powerful members of their respective Dinka and Nuer ethnic groups - led to the civil war which erupted in December 2013. They only agreed to settle their differences under intense international pressure, signing a peace deal in August 2015 - and Mr Machar returned to Juba as vice-president in a unity government in April. But battles then broke out between his bodyguards and presidential guards three months later, prompting him to flee. Another member of his party has been appointed as vice-president, a move Mr Machar does not recognise. Earlier this week, a report funded by George Clooney accused both Mr Kiir and Mr Machar, as well as their officials, of personally profiting from the war. Both men have denied the allegations. The UN wants to deploy a 4,000-strong regional protection force for Juba which would have a more robust mandate than the 12,000 UN soldiers already in the country, however the mandate and size of the force still have to be agreed.

She wants a 50p tax on those earning over £150,000, and a penny increase in income tax to pay for public services. The conference will vote on Tuesday on plans to give the Scottish and Welsh leaders more power over their parties. The proposals would allow Kezia Dugdale and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones the power to appoint a representative to the party's UK national executive committee (NEC). The plans would also give the Scottish and Welsh parties more autonomy. Sources have said there was an attempt to \"unpick\" the plans by removing the extra seats from the package. This was defeated, but it is possible there could be a second attempt prior to Tuesday's vote. Speaking at the weekend, Len McCluskey, head of the UK's biggest trade union Unite, said Ms Dugdale should not have the power to appoint Scotland's representative on the NEC. He said that while there was wide support for the autonomy proposals, coupling them with the NEC seat plans had created a \"difficult position\". Ms Dugdale has said she is confident the full package will be passed. It appears Kezia Dugdale and Jeremy Corbyn are involved in their first dispute since his re-election. A series of reforms to the way the Labour Party works are due to be passed on Tuesday. The package includes autonomy plans praised by Ms Dugdale last week. This part is uncontroversial and supported by everyone I've spoken to. But there is a row over another part. The reforms would also allow Ms Dugdale - and her Welsh counterpart Carwyn Jones - to appoint someone to represent them on the party's UK executive. Mr Corbyn's supporters think the extra NEC seats could be used to try and undermine him as the battle for the party's future plays out. They want to postpone the plan.

Talal Barazi, governor of Homs, says 111 men have been questioned and released, while 190 others are still being held. More than 1,100 people have fled the city since Friday under a truce. Aid organisations in Syria had hoped to evacuate more civilians on Tuesday after the ceasefire was extended by three days, but the operation was delayed by a day due to logistical reasons. \"The evacuation of civilians and delivery of food aid will continue tomorrow morning,\" the regional governor told the AFP news agency. A truce agreed until Wednesday night could be extended if necessary, he added.

Writing in The Guardian, Michael Billington said the new production had given the show \"a new lease of life\". \"Close delivers the big lines not with a camp flourish but as if they were sincerely felt,\" he said. Billington noted that the show had \"none of the epic scale of the original London production\" but added this was to the producers' credit: \"Sometimes semi-staged is better than the luxurious grandeur of an elephantine West End musical.\" Glenn Close is reprising the role of Norma Desmond, a character she first played in Los Angeles in 1993. She won a Tony award for her Broadway performance in 1995. Holly Williams from theatre website WhatsOnStage said: \"It might be 20 years since she bagged a Tony in this part, but I wouldn't bet against her scooping a few shiny new gongs this time round.\" However, some critics did note that Close's voice occasionally struggled with the higher notes. \"[Close's] vocal instrument may not be as sharp as it once was, but she brings an utterly ferocious intensity to the part and the songs,\" Mark Shenton wrote in his review for The Stage. Time Out also had some criticisms of the production: \"Like many later Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals, Sunset Boulevard is not brilliant.\" Andrzej Lukowski added that \"69-year-old Close is definitely a bit old to play 50-year-old silent movie star Norma Desmond\". Rod McPhee, writing in The Daily Mirror, said Close \"masterfully belts out the show's biggest numbers, and earned rapturous applause as a result.

The Klos-C, a Panamanian-flagged vessel, is currently being escorted to the southern Israeli port of Eilat, and is expected to arrive on Saturday. Its 17-member crew were apparently unaware of their cargo. The Klos-C was transporting dozens of M-302 rockets, which have a range of 150km to 200km (93-124 miles), Israeli military spokesman Brig-Gen Moti Almoz said. \"The ship may be carrying other weapons as well, but we can only know this when it reaches Eilat.\" \"There is clear and unequivocal information that this came from Iran.\" On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had tracked the weapons for several months as they were flown from Damascus to Tehran and then taken to a port in southern Iran. From there, it added, they were loaded on to the KLOS-C, which sailed to Iraq, where containers of cement were added. The ship was eventually intercepted while on its way to Sudan. On Thursday, Mr Zarif rejected the allegations and questioned why they had surfaced just after the conference a pro-Israel US lobby group. \"An Iranian ship carrying arms for Gaza,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Captured just in time for annual AIPAC anti-Iran campaign.

He was under the command of pro-Moscow's Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia's Chechen Republic in the North Caucasus. The other four defendants are brothers Anzor Gubashev and Shadid Gubashev, Khamzat Bakhayev and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov. A sixth man, Beslan Shabanov, died while he was being detained in Chechnya.

Southampton City Council estimates the port contributes up to 23 per cent of air pollution in the city. Ships can use a \"plug-in\" system to reduce emissions but not in the UK. It comes after the World Health Organisation (WHO) called Southampton one of the most polluted cities in the UK. The city's port welcomes thousands of ships a year, including some of the biggest cruise liners and container ships in the world. The vessels leave their engines running while docked to power their electrics, but elsewhere in the world ships use a shore-based electricity supply, virtually eliminating their emissions. Cargo and cruise ships, including the Queen Mary 2 and Britannia which regularly dock in Southampton, use the method - just not when visiting the British port. Port Director Alastair Welch from ABP said: \"The challenge has been in particular there is no one standard for shore power. I'd like it in place as soon as possible. \"I should emphasise shore power is not the only answer and that's why we're working with solar power and hybrid ships now, because all of them have a part to play for the future.\" A review of Air Quality in Southampton in 2015 by the local authority showed the port is believed to contribute between seven and 23 per cent of the air pollution, while cars contribute 18 per cent and HGVs 12 per cent.

The two shared a stage at Winston-Salem in North Carolina. Introducing Mrs Obama, the former first lady said her voice was needed in this election \"more than ever\".

The Republican candidate's reaction, in which he implied the mother was not allowed to speak up, attracted strong condemnation from within his own party. Speaking to ABC News in an interview aired on Thursday, Mr Trump repeated his insistence that their son would be alive, but added he believed the soldier was a \"great hero\".

The taskforce has warned that the number of people falling behind on their mortgage payments could increase as interest rates begin to rise. The taskforce is now undertaking further work aimed at developing policy recommendations. Northern Ireland suffered a huge housing bubble followed by a crash that saw prices fall by almost 50%. As a consequence, rates of negative equity are much worse than elsewhere in the UK and repossessions have also increased. A major \"at risk\" group identified by the taskforce are households who undertook \"equity release\" remortgages at the height of the market. They are people who increased their mortgages to release cash for other purposes, such as home improvements or to finance buy-to-let properties. In 2007, 74% of remortgaging in Northern Ireland was for equity release. The taskforce said this category of \"credit hungry\" borrower was disproportionately active in Northern Ireland. Lower income groups who took out \"second charge\" mortgages with subprime lenders are also at high-risk. The taskforce said those lenders have shown \"a more tenacious approach to arrears management\". However, it said, in general, lenders have shown \"forbearance\" and if they had not done so rates of repossessions would be higher. The taskforce warned that, despite a gradual recovery in the Northern Ireland economy and the housing market, major risks remain. It said that the Northern Ireland economy \"remains some distance from reaching escape velocity\"' and that borrowers are \"poorly equipped to absorb future income shocks\".\n",

In 1979, the Sandinista revolution overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza and Borge served as interior minister in the new government of Daniel Ortega. US President Ronald Reagan saw the revolutionaries as a threat and backed the right-wing Contras in the civil war that followed. An estimated 30,000 people died in the fighting which lasted a decade and wrecked the country's economy. Borge was born into a poor family and dedicated himself to the struggle against the Somoza family, which had run Nicaragua for 40 years. He received military training in Cuba before he helped to found the Sandinista movement. The organisation was named after Augusto Cesar Sandino, who fought against US intervention in Nicaragua in the 1930s. Borge became the powerful interior minister in the Ortega government of the 1980s, where he imposed censorship on the media and was accused of human rights violations. However, he denied accusations that he was responsible for expelling and harassing clergymen during the war. The Sandinistas were voted out of power in 1990. Congressman Jacinto Suarez was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying Borge was \"a transcendental figure in Nicaraguan history\". But the news agency also quoted Nicaraguan writer Gioconda Belli, who said of Borge's later life: \"After 1990, I have the sense he gave up his revolutionary ideas...

During his first news conference at Old Trafford, Van Gaal insisted he was more \"democrat\" than autocrat, extolling his \"strong personality\" - a trait, he reminded his audience, he shares with former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. But why does Van Gaal come to English football with such a fearsome reputation? BBC Sport gets the inside story on his biggest bust-ups. The time he was told he was too slow Louis van Gaal never lacked confidence and his strong personality was there, even as a player. He made his name as a midfielder with the Royal FC Antwerp, under Guy Thys, the legendary Belgian coach. \"I was annoyed that he did not always play me,\" Van Gaal later recalled. \"I was one of four foreigners and he could only play three in those days. Thys reckoned I lacked pace.'' Thys said: \"He'd come up to me and ask me why I did not play him. 'Boss, I am the best player, aren't I?' And then I would tell him he was not. He could not believe that. \"I do admit he had by far the strongest personality of all the players I have come across. But, sorry to say, he was slow... \" One of Van Gaal's best performances came in a 4-1 victory over Aston Villa in the home leg of the Uefa Cup tie in 1975. \"That day against Villa he was absolutely brilliant,\" Thys remembered. \"For the return match he asked how he should play. I said: 'Like you normally do, slowly.' \"I remember that conversation well. He could not see the funny side of my answer. But we needed to take the pace out of the game. And it worked. We beat them in Birmingham 1-0. And Louis was fantastic again. He never played such a brilliant game again.'' Van Gaal\n",

Luckily her dress was found but what is the appeal for brides of choosing a dress once worn by a relative? Three women explained why they had ditched trawling the bridal shops for the perfect dress in favour of a borrowed gown. Kate Ridgway, from Stockport, made the decision to wear her grandmother's wedding dress in 2014. \"I remember it from when I was a child,\" said the 27-year-old. \"I always knew nan had kept it and I tried it on for dressing up, but back then I thought it was a horrid lacy thing.\" However, when she got engaged to her now-husband Stu, Joan Chatfield, known as \"Nanny Chat\", asked if she would like to wear it on her big day. \"I was heavily pregnant at the time, so I couldn't try it on,\" said Kate. \"But she had always wanted me to wear it.\" Then, three days after Kate's eldest son was born, her nan passed away. When she travelled down to Sussex for the funeral, her mother handed her the box with the vintage wedding dress from 1951, and everything fell into place. \"When I tried it on, it fitted perfectly,\" she said. \"I had it cleaned but I didn't have to do anything else to it. \"I had tried on brand new wedding dresses and I had fallen in love with one, but this felt different and so special. \"It meant so much to us as a family for me to wear it and, as you can imagine, it made for a very emotional day.\" London-based digital designer Emily Clark also hopes to start a tradition of her own by using her mother's frock for her wedding this October. The 33-year-old said her mother's dress, which was first worn in 1980, had played a big part in her childhood. \"I used to dress in my mum's wedding dress from the age of five or six to - if I'm truthful - until I was 15. \"It's one of a kind, it's a dress you wouldn\n",

He admitted abusing 18 children at Addenbrooke's in Cambridge between 2009 and 2013. The mother of the 11-year-old abused when he was kept on as a patient told the BBC Bradbury should never be freed. Bradbury, 41, from Herringswell in Suffolk, was jailed at Cambridge Crown Court for sexual assault, voyeurism and possessing more than 16,000 indecent images. The court heard the images of his victims were taken in the hospital. Victims told investigators Bradbury had focused on examining their private parts when there was no medical need to do so. The child, who is now 13, was referred to Bradbury because his older sister had a blood disorder and it was feared he might have the same condition. But, his mother said, there was nothing wrong with him. Instead of discharging him from his patient list, Bradbury continued seeing and abusing the boy for a year. The boy is currently on heavy medication to deal with the mental effects of his abuse. His mother said she did not know how Bradbury could appeal. She said: \"He is in prison now, probably doing his crafts or whatever. We are suffering every day. \"He does not understand the knock-on effect he has had on families.\" Bradbury's appeal will be heard at the Royal Courts of Justice on 12 June.\n",

Once Scotland's undisputed number seven, he has suffered an awful run of bad luck culminating with the loss of his Test place to Hamish Watson. \"I've been unfortunate, but I'm looking to put it behind me and finish the season on a real high,\" said Hardie. The New Zealand-born back-row, 28, was one of Scotland's stars at the 2015 World Cup, his work-rate and impact at the breakdown catching the eye. He was talked about as one of the players of the tournament, but this season has brought one setback after another. In November, during a bruising Test against Australia, Hardie suffered damage to his ankle and knee, while also suffering a concussion. It took him two months to recover. Following on from that, he was selected to play against Wales in the Six Nations but had to retire after just 24 minutes. Then he appeared as a substitute in the game against France but only lasted five minutes before having to go off injured again. Townsend named Hardie in the starting line-up for his first Test as Scotland coach, against Italy in Singapore, but Hardie suffered a back spasm in the warm-up and had to withdraw. \"Everybody gets injuries and everybody has low patches, but rehab is a really good time to look at it as a positive, even though it isn't so much,\" Hardie told BBC Scotland. \"You have to get your body right and get other aspects of your rugby game right.

The reported sales surge comes amid an ongoing boycott targeting business interests of the fashion entrepreneur's father, President Donald Trump. Last month several retailers dropped Ms Trump's label, citing falling sales. In an interview with fashion magazine Refinery29, Ms Klem declined to cite specific sales figures, but research by a market analytics firm seems to support the claim. According to Lyst, a London-based e-commerce website which tracks clothing retail, sales of Ivanka Trump products rocketed in February. It says sales increased 346% from January to February this year and 557%, compared with average orders last year. \"To see such an extreme spike in one month is completely unheard of and came as a huge surprise to us,\" says Lyst's US spokesperson Sarah Tanner. Ms Klem said that most products are sold to women in New York, California and Texas, and the average shopper earns between $60,000-100,000 per year (£50,000-£82,000). She said the political controversy surrounding President Trump, and the boycott, may have helped his daughter's brand. The reported sales surge comes after Kellyanne Conway, a counsellor to President Trump, was accused of breaking ethics rules by promoting Ivanka Trump products during a live TV interview from the White House. The first daughter's perfume is currently highest ranked on Amazon.com, with many shoppers leaving pro-Trump comments. \"I bought this without knowing what it smelt like, and I didn't care!

It boiled down to Mr Magufuli's popularity, which superseded that of the governing Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) that has dominated politics since independence from British rule in 1961. So what are the five big challenges he faces once in office? Change was the buzzword during the election campaign. Now people will expect him to engage in a major house-cleaning exercise by showing the door to corrupt government officials and old-school public servants. This will pose a huge political risk, as they are well-entrenched in CCM. But Mr Magufuli, the former works minister, will have to tackle corruption head-on, as Tanzanians have had enough of it. His first big test will come with the appointment of a cabinet. Will it be made up of people untainted by corruption? If not, voters will be disappointed. After all, he has built his political career on the promise that he is not scared of taking risks, and that he works hard and acts fast. Although the official unemployment rate is at around 10%, people sometimes get the impression that the crisis bigger - a recent advert for 70 jobs in the public service posts attracted more than 10,000 applications. Interviews had to be held in a football stadium. Almost half of Tanzania's 50 million-strong population is made up of young people, and they are worst-affected by unemployment. They voted with great enthusiasm, believing their fortunes will change under Mr Magufuli. He will be under most pressure from them to deliver on his promise to create jobs - and end poverty. He has promised to revive industries which are in bad shape, like the cotton and fish processing sectors. Mr Magufuli has promised children free education from kindergarten to secondary school. While many Tanzanians welcome this, they feel it is not enough. They want a higher standard of education with improved curriculums so that Tanzania can have a better-skilled work force. Mr Magufuli will be hard-pressed to meet their demands -\n",

Essien thinks Mourinho could do it again with his side top of the table. He told BBC Sport: \"There is still a long way to go but I'm sure they are in a good position and once Jose is ahead it is very difficult to overtake him.\" Essien, who now plays for AC Milan, sees similarities between the current Chelsea side and the one he played for when Mourinho signed him from Lyon during his first spell in charge in 2005. In an interview with BBC Sport, the Ghana international - who also played under Mourinho during a loan spell at Real Madrid - assesses the qualities of his former boss and Chelsea's prospects. He also discusses his work with the #UnitedAgainstEbola project, a campaign for Health Africa International launched to try and combat the threat of ebola and the potential impact of the disease on the up-coming Africa Cup of Nations. Essien on Chelsea: \"It's not a big surprise they are doing so well. Whoever works under Jose will tell you that he is the sort of man who always gets the best out of his players. \"The way they are playing now reminds me of when I first came to Chelsea. We were very hard to beat and we won most of our games and they are doing it this year. \"They have a lot of young players who can step up. I think they are going to become like Chelsea of years ago.

Ninety concert-goers were killed at the Bataclan concert hall, where Eagles of Death Metal were playing. Dozens more people died in co-ordinated attacks across Paris on 13 November. The policeman, a department head at the Paris anti-crime brigade (BAC), told FranceInfo radio (in French) that he and his colleague had been responding to reports of an explosion at the Stade de France when they were redirected. They were ordered to go to the 10th and 11th arrondissements of Paris following news of shootings. On the way, they found panicked concert-goers fleeing the Bataclan and quickly decided to go inside. \"What surprised us immediately was the extremely bright light that blinded us,\" said the officer, whose identity has been protected for security reasons. \"The bewildering silence... and then hundreds of bodies one on top of the other.\" What happened at the Bataclan? Who were the victims? Soon after entering the music venue, the police duo saw a gunman walk on stage and point a Kalashnikov at an audience member. \"He was very calm,\" the officer said. \"Given the carnage, there was no doubt about what we had to do. We opened fire straight away. We kept shooting until he fell to the floor.\" The gunman was later identified as Foued Mohamed-Aggad, a 23-year-old French national from Strasbourg. The two officers, who reportedly only had service weapons and light bulletproof vests, then heard an explosion from elsewhere in the building and realised there were likely to be more attackers. Faced with extreme danger, the men phoned their loved-ones. \"We decided we could not leave the scene - we could not leave these people,\" the officer said. \"I was ready to die with my team that night.

Mr Boyce has been given a £90,000 grant from England Heritage, but feels there should be more support for landowners who find themselves in his position. Landowners are responsible for the initial exploration costs of excavations found on their property, and the cost rises if human remains are discovered and have to be excavated. Mr Boyce told BBC Inside Out: \"History has been changed (by the discovery) but you've seriously got to weigh up the costs.

Hundreds of security force members and government personnel have been killed, with attacks creeping closer to the capital Cairo. The instability has threatened Egypt's important tourism industry.

The firm, with three million customers, said it had kept bills to the same level in real terms as in 2001. Meanwhile, research by Cardiff University claims the company is worth £1bn a year to the Welsh economy. Its financial results come in a different form to companies with shares on the stock market. It is owned by the not-for-profit company Glas Cymru and savings or efficiencies are ploughed back into Dwr Cymru or used to keep bills as low as possible. Mr Annett, with Mr Jones, founded Glas Cymru 12 years ago, and he said the idea stems from the notion that having a public service company, which is a monopoly, being run on the basis of profit maximisation for shareholders does not work in the customers' interest. He said there were cases where the Glas Cymru non-profit model of ownership could work elsewhere in other businesses and industries. Mr Jones said of the job awaiting him: \"There are some big challenges ahead. \"We're a company that has to have a long-term vision, looking to invest in assets that will be around for the next for the next 20, 30 and 40 years, so we have to make the right decisions. \"We have to balance that investment with the need to strive to keep bills down for our customers as well because everyone is feeling the pinch in difficult circumstances.\" Research also published on Thursday by Cardiff Business School said that Dwr Cymru contributes £1bn into the Welsh economy every year. The study claims for every £1 spent by the company, another 56p is generated for the rest of the Welsh economy. The report also quotes the water regulator Ofwat saying that between 2009/10 and 2014/15 Dwr Cymru customers face the lowest increase in average household bills of all water and sewerage companies in England and Wales. On top of the £338m spent on infrastructure last year, the company is committing another £650m over the next two years, which it is argued will employ 1,000 construction workers.

The $238bn (£158bn) raised would be used to fund road projects in the US. But analysts say it is unlikely the Republican-controlled Congress will approve the proposals. Mr Obama told broadcaster NBC that despite several years of economic improvement, wages and incomes for middle class families were \"just now ticking up\". \"They haven't been keeping pace over the last 30 years compared to, you know, corporate profits and what's happening to folks in the very top,\" he said. Research firm Audit Analytics calculated last April that US firms in total had $2.1tn-worth of profits stashed abroad. It found US conglomerate General Electric had the most profit stored overseas at $110bn. Tech giants Microsoft and Apple and drugs companies Pfizer and Merck all featured in the top five. No tax is currently due on foreign profits as long as they are not brought into the US. As a result some companies put their earnings in low tax jurisdictions and simply leave them there. The White House said its plans for an immediate 14% tax would raise $238bn, which would be used to fund a wider $478bn public works programme of road, bridge and public transport upgrades. \"This transition tax would mean that companies have to pay US tax right now on the $2tn they already have overseas, rather than being able to delay paying any US tax indefinitely,\" a White House official said. The official said that after this one-off tax, the 19% permanent tax firms would have to pay on overseas profits \"would level the playing field, and encourage firms to create jobs here at home.\" The tax rate is far lower than the current US top corporate tax rate of 35%. Also expected in Mr Obama's budget proposal is a tax cut on earned incomes, including tax credits for child care and \"second earners\". Mr Obama will also seek to ease restrictions on military and domestic spending in place since a budget deal in 2011.

I'm playing a young player - it is a big challenge.\" After recovering from a set and 5-1 down against Elina Svitolina in the quarter-final, Halep led from the front against Pliskova. With the number-one ranking and the prospect of a first Grand Slam title on the line, it was Halep who grasped the opportunity. The 25-year-old broke serve in game three as her speed and accuracy proved too much for the wayward Pliskova. The Czech made 24 errors in losing the first set, but finally edged ahead at 4-2 in the second. Pliskova, 25, had said throughout the tournament that she was surprised at her progress on the clay, but for half an hour her powerful hitting held sway and there was little Halep could do. The Romanian was under pressure early in the decider but finally chased down a forehand and fired a brilliant cross-court winner to grab a 3-1 lead. Pliskova would cut the deficit to 4-3 only to blaze a forehand long, leaving Halep to serve out the match after two hours. Ostapenko was well into uncharted territory, ranked 47th and having never been past the third round at a Grand Slam before, but she relished the big stage.

Spokeswoman Luba Samri told the AFP news agency that they were freed \"with no conditions attached, after being interviewed and giving statements\". The BBC's Kevin Connolly in Jerusalem says Tabgha is a sacred site to the many thousands of Christian pilgrims who visit the Holy Land every year. The arson attack on the Church of the Multiplication of the Loaves and Fishes caused extensive damage to a book shop and other buildings at the complex but did not destroy the 5th Century mosaic floors which are its key archaeological feature. Two people who had been staying at the complex were also taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation. A verse from a Hebrew prayer denouncing the worship of \"idols\" was found spray-painted in red on a wall of the church.

The move would have made Seagal a potential intermediary between the White House and the Kremlin, Buzzfeed reported. The US refused. Seagal, whose grandmother was from Vladivostok in Russia's far east, has made frequent trips to Russia in recent years and visited Kamchatka and Sakhalin in September. He said during the visit that he wanted to spend several months a year in the country, Russia's Tass news agency reported. Seagal follows other celebrities including French actor Gerard Depardieu, US mixed martial arts fighter Jeff Monson, US boxer Roy Jones and US snowboarder Vic Wild in taking Russian citizenship. Earlier this year Seagal was given Serbian nationality after offering to set up a martial arts school in the capital Belgrade. The action star's movie credits include Under Siege and Flight of Fury and he has also starred in his own US reality TV show, Steven Seagal: Lawman.\n",

But pregnant women should make sure they take folic acid and vitamin D, as well as eating a well-balanced diet, as per NHS guidelines, they add. Supplements-makers said some women were not getting enough nutrients. The researchers said folic acid had the strongest evidence to support its use - taking 400 micrograms a day can protect against abnormalities called neural tube defects in the developing baby. Vitamin D - 10 micrograms a day - is recommended for healthy bones in the mother and baby. Some women can get these two pills for free on the Healthy Start scheme. A supplement that can be dangerous in pregnancy is vitamin A. Too much can harm the baby. The researchers said pregnant women might feel coerced into buying expensive multivitamins in order to give their baby the best start in life. But they would do well to resist the marketing claims, which did not seem to translate into better outcomes for mother or baby, they said. \"The only supplements recommended for all women during pregnancy are folic acid and vitamin D, which are available at relatively low cost,\" they said. Janet Fyle, from the Royal College of Midwives, said: \"We would encourage women who are pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant to have a healthy, varied diet including fresh fruit and vegetables, alongside taking folic acid supplements. \"We would also stress that there is no need for pregnant women to 'eat for two'. \"This is a myth, and all that is required is a normal balanced amount of food.\" The Health Food Manufacturers' Association, which represents the food supplements industry, insists that a substantial proportion of women of child-bearing age are not getting enough nutrients from diet alone. The industry-funded Health Supplements Information Service said food supplements could help plug dietary gaps.\n",

But Warburton played down accusations that their goal-scoring has dried up, and pointed to their goal difference of 31 after 14 games, which he said speaks volumes about the potency of his squad. \"Other teams have gone on a very, very good run of form and teams who dropped points at the start of the season have put a run together,\" he said. \"All credit to them as it's hard to put a run together at any time in football. So I don't think it's Rangers' form dipping, it's other teams improving. \"If we are 10, 11 or 12 points clear and we lose three games of football, while the other teams win their games, then I would agree (there is a crisis). Rangers currently sit level with Hibernian on points at the Championship summit, topping the table on goal difference, but have a game in hand over the Edinburgh outfit. The two meet next at Ibrox on 28 December and, while it is on his radar, Warburton said they will not take their eye off the ball in preparation for that clash. \"I think it's dangerous to do that, and that's the natural outlook I understand that perfectly and everyone will be saying all eyes are on the 28th, but I think we've got to look at the fact that that's a banana skin - you've got to watch games in between. \"There's no point focussing on the game four or five weeks ahead if you drop points in the meantime.\" Striker Martyn Waghorn\n",

The largest earthquake in the Lothians was in Rosewell on 9 October 1986 with a 2.8 magnitude on the Richter Scale. Among the other areas with the most geological activity were Clackmannanshire and Dumfries. A seismometer at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh records earthquakes within a 30km (19 miles) radius. More recently there was a 2.2 magnitude earthquake recorded in Penicuik in Midlothian on 13 November 2014. There were two 2.3 magnitude earthquakes in Penicuik on 30 November and 9 December 2007. Davie Galloway, British Geological Survey seismologist, told the BBC Scotland news website, that an earthquake over 2 magnitude would feel like a lorry passing your house and it would make windows rattle. He said: \"People think we don't get earthquakes because we are not on the edge of a plate but we do. \"Although we sit on the middle of a plate on the earth's crust we still have earthquakes although not on the same magnitude as for example Japan. \"We also get them in old mining areas. If the stress exceeds the strength of the rock then it can create an earthquake.\" The largest-known earthquake to ever hit the UK had a magnitude of 6.1 on 7 June 1931 in the North Sea. It was felt across most of Britain with damage reported from 71 different places. Ben Flanagan at Esri UK, said: \"We wanted to examine where Scotland's earthquakes occurred to see if any patterns emerged and uncover the myth that the country doesn't get that many. \"Modern mapping techniques enabled us to plot all 10,000 across the UK and reveal Scotland's areas of highest seismic activity.\"\n",

Country profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring Barbados is one of the more populous and prosperous Caribbean islands. Political, economic and social stability have given it one of the highest standards of living in the developing world. As well as being a centre for financial services, it also has offshore reserves of oil and natural gas. However, the economy took something of a knock in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. The country's public debt rose sharply in 2009-11, mainly because of a slowdown in the tourism and financial services sectors. Prior to the economic crisis there was a construction boom, with new hotels and housing complexes springing up. The trend accelerated as the island prepared to host some of the key Cricket World Cup matches in 2007. However, a shortage of jobs has prompted many Barbadians - more often known as Bajans - to find work abroad. The money that they send home is an important source of income. Most Barbadians are the descendants of African slaves who were brought to the island from the 17th century to work the sugar cane plantations. Limestone caverns, coral reefs and a warm climate tempered by trade winds are among the island's natural assets. Barbados is relatively flat, with highlands in the interior.\n",

Events have certainly moved quickly. A year ago France was in the middle of a nasty spat over warships which it was refusing to sell to Vladimir Putin. For France, the Russian leader was a destabilising presence on Europe's eastern borders. EU sanctions - intended to contain Russian ambitions in Crimea and Ukraine - had full French backing. Today there are more pressing concerns. In the wake of the Paris attacks, President Hollande had a vision of a single, united international coalition - the nations of the world working together to eradicate IS. Realities have since deflated that ambition. The Americans and the Russians are not going to work together any time soon. And the Turko-Russian crisis over the downed Sukhoi Russian warplane is a further complication. But still, the French want as many countries on side as possible. And the Russians - by dint of their military presence in Syria - are a major player. As one diplomatic official told Le Monde: \"Right now we are probably more prepared to work with the Russians than Barack Obama is.\" President Hollande has two goals in his talks with Vladimir Putin. First he wants to persuade Russia to direct its airstrikes away from the \"moderate\" Syrian opposition and onto targets belonging to IS. Second, he wants a firmer understanding that Russia will not stick indefinitely behind Bashar al-Assad. The French feel they have made a significant change in policy by de-prioritising the removal of the Syrian leader. It took a good deal of pride-swallowing to make the concession, because until two weeks ago Paris was President Assad's greatest scourge. But there is only so far that the French will go down this line. And they feel Russia should also give some slack. There are a number of factors in favour of a rapprochement. First of all, Russia has itself now come face-to-face with IS terrorism - with the destruction of the tourist plane from Sharm el-Sheikh. This has jolted perceptions in Moscow, for which IS is\n",

Aidan said that when he came out as a boy his mother was \"definitely heartbroken\". \"I feel like she had dreams of seeing her daughter getting married and having children,\" he said. \"She definitely needed time to mourn and I needed to let her have that time.\" Source: Department for Education, The Equality Act 2010 and schools When he told the school he did not want to be addressed as a girl or wear girl's clothes, he claims staff said it was a \"phase\" that he would grow out of. He said he was told he was \"attention seeking\". \"They didn't really take it seriously,\" he added. Mother Jackie described the school's treatment as \"appalling\". \"They made my child out to be a freak and someone who would contaminate other students,\" she claimed.

A decision whether to turn off his life support machines is being considered by the High Court. Connie Yates and Chris Gard want to take their son who has progressive muscle weakness to the US. A crowdfunding campaign for the trip is now less than £60,000 short of its £1.3m target. The judge is analysing medical evidence at a hearing in the Family Division before deciding what option is in Charlie's best interests. The neurologist who would oversee the treatment told the court that while Charlie was in the \"terminal stage\" of his illness, treating him would be compassionate. He said the therapy, which would be tried for six months, would provide a \"small chance\" of a meaningful improvement in Charlie's brain function. \"[Charlie] may be able to interact. To smile. To look at objects,\" he said. Sophia Roper, representing Charlie's parents, also told the court there was \"no evidence that he is on a regular basis in pain\". Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital said the baby receives 24-hour care and should be allowed to die with dignity. But the couple, who live in London, believe seven-month-old Charlie may have a chance of surviving if he receives treatment abroad. \"We just want to have our chance. It would never be a cure but it could help him live. If it saves him, amazing,\" Miss Yates said. \"I want to save others.

Mr Barrymore, who was not present for the High Court decision, values his claim at more than £2.4m. Essex Police said there were still \"unanswered\" questions over Mr Lubbock's death. Michael Barrymore: How the British TV king lost his crown A figure for the damages to be paid to Mr Barrymore - whose real name is Michael Parker - is yet to be set. Mr Barrymore was arrested in 2007 in connection with the 31-year-old's death. Mr Justice Stuart-Smith, sitting in London on Friday, ruled against the force, which had argued Mr Barrymore should only receive a nominal payout. The judge did not decide on the sum to be awarded, as his ruling dealt only with the preliminary issue of the level of damages to be awarded to Mr Barrymore. The case centred on whether Essex Police had reasonable grounds to lawfully arrest Mr Barrymore. While Mr Justice Stuart-Smith found there was \"information available to the police that could have provided an arresting officer with reasonable grounds for a lawful arrest\" the one officer with sufficient information to carry it out was not there at the time the entertainer was arrested. That officer was stuck in traffic at the time, Essex Police said. As a result, said Mr Justice Stuart-Smith, the arrest was unlawful and Mr Barrymore was therefore \"entitled to recover more than nominal damages\". During a previous hearing, a lawyer for Mr Barrymore told how the arrest had affected his client. Hugh Tomlinson QC said Mr Barrymore, the former host of My Kind Of People and Strike it Lucky, was never charged with any offence and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) later made it \"crystal clear\" there was no basis for any charges. He said Mr Barrymore remained convinced that Mr Lubbock's injuries were not caused at his home but he did not know what happened.

The bodies, which are in an advanced state of decomposition, were found during works to refurbish the jail. So far none of the remains have been identified. The grave was discovered on Thursday and the number of bodies found since has risen from seven to 14. Forensic experts are continuing with their search and have not ruled out finding more bodies buried on the prison grounds. On Friday, prison minister Iris Varela wrote on Twitter that she had contacted the relatives of two inmates to ask for their help identifying the remains. The two prisoners disappeared when inmates were relocated from the General Penitentiary of Venezuela to other jails in October. An estimated 9,000 prisoners were locked up in the jail near the town of San Juan de los Morros prior to its closure, according to non-governmental organisation A Window on Freedom. The NGO says Venezuelan jails are woefully overcrowded and that last year 173 inmates died while in custody. But Ms Varela told Venezuelan state broadcaster VTV that the country had taken huge steps to improve the conditions of its prisons. She said that all of the country's women's and youth prisons had been brought up to new standards set by the Venezuelan government. \"This is an achievement without precedent of the Bolivarian Revolution and the government of our president, Nicolas Maduro,\" she said. She said that President Maduro had asked her in 2014 to \"impose maximum discipline\" in Venezuelan jails. \"Well, here I am fulfilling the president's orders,\" she said. She did not refer further to the remains found except to say that forensic tests were being carried out.\n",

Mr Putin is now into his third term as president since 2000, battling an economic crisis. Critics say civil liberties have been steadily eroded under his rule. He remains one of the world's most recognisable politicians, and has topped the list of The World's Most Powerful People compiled by Forbes magazine for the third year running. On other issues raised at the news conference, President Putin Russia deployed its air force to Syria in September in support of President Bashar al-Assad and has been carrying out air strikes on his opponents. Its intervention has been heavily criticised by Turkey, the US and Gulf Arab states. Mr Putin said the downing of the Russian jet by Turkish warplanes on the Syria-Turkey border was a \"hostile act\" but Russia was \"not the country\" to run away. He said he saw \"no prospect\" of ties improving with Turkey - which Russia has put under sanctions - under its current leaders. There was, he said, a \"creeping Islamisation of Turkey that would have Ataturk rolling in his grave\". The remark appeared to be aimed at President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose AKP party, with its Islamist roots, has been accused of seeking to dismantle the secular state founded by Kemal Ataturk.

Around 100,000 people in the United Kingdom have multiple sclerosis or MS, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Society. It is normally diagnosed in people between the ages of 20 and 40. Symptoms might include fatigue, vision problems and difficulties with walking, but MS is different for everyone. In MS, the protective layer surrounding nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord - known as myelin - becomes damaged. The immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin, causing scarring or sclerosis. The damaged myelin disrupts the nerve signals - rather like the short circuit caused by a frayed electrical cable. If the process of inflammation and scarring is not treated, then eventually the condition can cause permanent neurodegeneration. Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of the MS Society, said: \"MS is an unpredictable and challenging condition to live with and diagnosis can be upsetting and scary. The MS Society is here to help anyone affected by MS.\" MS Society helpline: 0808 800 8000.\n",

The security forces say the stand-off has now been brought to an end. The US state department has confirmed the death of a US citizen, without giving any further details. The dead American is believed to have been a security contractor. The French national is reported to have been working for Libya's Buraq Air.

There has been strong evidence to suggest an IS presence in the eastern Libyan city of Derna since October, with a group there publicly declaring allegiance to its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. However, the command structure is still a mystery to most foreign observers. The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli says that in the past month there has been a string of incidents in western Libya, including abductions and bombings, that have been claimed by IS social media accounts. But she says it has not been clearly established whether these groups are IS foot soldiers or people inspired by them.

Egypt was apparently caught by surprise when Ethiopia started diverting the Blue Nile last month, amid works to construct a hydroelectric dam. The river is a tributary of the Nile, on which Egypt is heavily dependent. The Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is a $4.7bn (£3.1bn) project that Ethiopia says will eventually provide 6,000 megawatts of power. It says the Blue Nile will be slightly diverted but will then be able to follow its natural course. \"Egypt's water security cannot be violated at all,\" Mr Morsi said on Monday. \"As president of the state, I confirm to you that all options are open.\" \"If Egypt is the Nile's gift, then the Nile is a gift to Egypt,'' he said, quoting popular sayings about the river in an emotive televised speech. \"The lives of the Egyptians are connected around it... as one great people. If it diminishes by one drop then our blood is the alternative.\" Analysts say Mr Morsi could be using the issue to distract attention from severe domestic political and economic challenges. Egypt is particularly dependant on water supply from the Nile, and its growing population has been placing that supply under increasing strain. Sudan is also reliant on Nile waters. Egypt cites a colonial era ruling to claim a right to the majority of the Nile's waters for itself and Sudan, but Ethiopia says the ruling is outdated. Mr Morsi said Egypt had no objection to development projects on Nile basin states, \"but on condition that those projects do not affect or damage Egypt's legal and historical rights\".

It also said that in a minority of experiments, the justification for using monkeys was \"not compelling\". The review was led by Professor Sir Patrick Bateson. The current president of the Zoological Society of London was commissioned by the main bodies that fund medical research in Britain. They wanted him to assess whether the studies on non-human primates (NHPs) were necessary, high-quality and yielded significant advances in medical science. Animal welfare groups opposed to experimentation on monkeys called again for the practice to be banned outright. They described Prof Bateson's review a \"chilling insight into primate research\". Although the proportion of monkeys used in research compared with other animals is low, less than 0.1%, there is concern that they suffer more than other species during experimentation, and so should only be used if those studies are expected to yield important medical benefits and if there is no other way of carrying out the research. The review suggested that this standard might not have been achieved in all cases. \"Not everything is rosy in the garden,\" Prof Bateson told reporters. He reviewed experiments on monkeys carried out between January 1997 and December 2006. Just under 3,000 animals were used in experiments in that period. The bulk of the research focused on neuroscience. Research on great apes is not permitted in the UK and so monkeys provide the next best animal models to study the human brain. Researchers often cite the widespread prevalence of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as a justification for research in this area. However, Prof Bateson said that the \"size of the problem should not be accepted as the sole justification for individual areas of research\". He added: \"Funders and researchers should avoid overstating and generalising the medical benefit (of research on monkeys). Instead, statements should be based on the actual scientific basis for funding decisions.\" Considerable suffering Prof Bateson and his team looked at 31 neuroscience studies. Half of the experiments involved considerable animal suffering. These were assessed as having a high scientific value. But in most cases, according to Prof Bateson, there was \"little direct evidence of medical benefit\".

Whatever you think of DRS, which uses different types of technology to determine if a batsman should be given out, it's very good that it's now being standardised. Everybody should play with it or nobody plays with it. At least now it brings everybody into line to play cricket together under the same regulations. However, on pitches which are bound to suit the spinners - an area where India excel - and wear appreciably over the five days of a Test, I imagine the decision will help the Indians immensely. Playing spinners with DRS in place is an altogether different and more challenging prospect than without it and it will make India more difficult to beat for England.

With a number of new players coming into the side, he's been able to show that it might possibly be the right thing for his side. Beforehand, batsmen like Sachin Tendulkar, for instance, were opposed to it. They felt the opposition would always keep a review up their sleeve especially for them because they were such key players. Ultimately, however, it's as simple as a change of attitude within the administration of the Indian cricket team which has led to this decision. Once we get onto the pitch, I think India, under their innovative new captain Virat Kohli, will use it well. Spin bowlers tend to have more success on the turning pitches of the subcontinent, and India have the world's number one bowler - off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin - in their ranks. England's batsmen must be careful how they play the spinning ball. For instance, you can't\n",

The video showed the beheading of David Haines and aid worker Alan Henning kneeling on the ground after his kidnap, Manchester Crown Court heard. Mr Mahmood denies all charges. He has pleaded not guilty to attempting to travel to Syria to commit acts of terrorism. Mr Mahmood also denies two counts of providing internet links to others with speeches and propaganda that encouraged acts of terrorism. He searched \"British man beheaded\" on his laptop before downloading the video, the court was told. It began with Prime Minister David Cameron talking about IS before images showing the beheading of Mr Haines. Julian Evans, prosecuting, said Mr Mahmood, \"undeterred by this graphic and violent imagery\", began looking up cheap flights to Bulgaria and Turkey. Then in the early hours of 18 September 2014, he left his home to board a flight from Manchester Airport to Bulgaria leaving a letter addressed, \"to family\", stating his intentions. Mr Evans said: \"He was telling his family in the clearest terms that he was leaving the comforts of his life in the UK in order to fight abroad on behalf of Allah and on behalf of Muslims. \"He did not care what others might think of him and his decision. \"Mr Mahmood planned to travel to Syria with the intention of committing acts of terrorism.\" The court heard his family had been unaware of his intentions and on the day he fled had reported him missing to police. Before he reached Syria, Mr Mahmood's brother persuaded him to come back to the UK via communications over Twitter. Mr Mahmood's interest in Syria, Jihad and IS was said to have developed over time from 2012, the court heard. The trial continues.\n",

Their spending, including at Bicester Village outlet, has also increased from almost £8m to more than £20m, according to Visit Britain. A further rise has been predicted for the next ten years. Martin Walker, from not-for-profit group Experience Oxfordshire, said Chinese tourists were \"increasingly important\" to the county's economy. However, he said, the UK was currently \"underperforming\" with about 290,000 visitors a year, compared to countries such as France, which gets 350,000. A number of attractions and travel organisations in Oxfordshire had signed up to the Great China Welcome initiative in a bid to encourage more visitors, he said. In 2013, consultancy company Spectrum Insights found Chinese tourists spend 90% of their budget on shopping during UK visits. It said Bicester Village was the most popular shopping destination in the UK, with 27% of Chinese visitors naming it as their favourite. Keith Slater, a former director of several UK retailers, said bosses had \"deliberately set out to market to the Chinese and to promote it as a must-go place.\" \"It's actually marketed as Bicester Village London, so is seen as part of the capital,\" he said. \"It's the designer brands, like Burberry, which really attract the Chinese and they prefer to buy a UK brand in the UK.\"\n",

As well as working at Folville Rise Junior School in Leicester, Farrands was a scoutmaster and lay preacher. The four victims were aged between six and 12 when Farrands abused them. Sentencing Farrands, Judge Nicholas Dean QC said: \"This was a breach of trust as a school teacher and a scoutmaster and the effect continues to haunt the victims. \"The sentence must seem lenient to the victims but they should look at the total sentence.\" He pleaded guilty to seven additional charges of indecent assault against boys between 1976 and 1981. Leicestershire Police said Farrands committed most of his crimes at Folville Rise Junior School. Det Sgt Hazel Sandall hopes the case will encourage other victims of historical abuse to come forward. She said: \"No matter how old the offender and no matter how many years ago crimes took place, we will conduct a thorough examination of the evidence and will not hesitate to seek charges being brought against perpetrators of crime where evidence is available to us.\" Two of the victims came to Leicester Crown Court, where Farrands appeared via video link, to see him sentenced. The court heard one victim contacted the NSPCC in 2014 and said he had been abused by Farrands and two other people, who he believed have since died. Some of the boys were assaulted multiple times. In a statement read out in court, one of the victims said he is still receiving counselling because of what happened. \"There is still a lot of pain,\" he said. \"I'm still unable to enjoy the simple things like Christmas and birthdays.\"\n",

The Springboks ran in eight second-half tries in all to earn a bonus-point win at the Olympic Stadium. South Africa top Pool B and will now play the loser of Saturday's Pool A decider between Australia and Wales. A mixture of South Africa's ill-discipline and poor finishing kept the score down in the first half, while USA only made it into the Boks' 22 in the last minute of the half, despite enjoying plenty of possession. Centre Damien de Allende scored his first international try before South Africa were awarded a penalty try as USA struggled at the scrum. A different South Africa came out after the break as Habana scored almost from the restart, collecting a Fourie du Preez kick to go over in the corner. Bismarck du Plessis and Francois Louw both crossed the line, before Habana scored two tries in two minutes to complete his hat-trick. Louw scored his second with Jesse Kriel also getting on the scoresheet, before Lwazi Mvovo rounded off a dominant Springboks performance. Habana had a subdued first half, with his only contribution of note seeing him clatter into Blaine Scully as the pair competed for a high ball. But he came out firing in the second half and his hat-trick not only saw him equal New Zealand legend Lomu as the tournament's all-time leading try scorer, but also draw level with Australia's David Campese for joint second in the list of Test try scorers with 64. The 32-year-old, a 2007 World Cup-winner with the Boks, scored 62 seconds into the second half for his 13th World Cup try. He then went over unopposed in the 59th minute after a break by De Allende and swooped on a loose ball to dive over in the corner just two minutes later.

As a result she missed her connecting flight to meet the cruise ship. Ms Russell has since received C$800 (US$592; £463) compensation from the airline. She says everything went according to plan until an agent told her about two hours after she had checked in and received her boarding pass that the flight was overbooked and she did not have a valid ticket. Despite showing her travel documents and getting the tour company to email her trip receipt to prove her ticket was valid, the flight left without her. \"It was extremely upsetting,\" Ms Russell told the CBC. \"The woman could not have been more rude, hostile. In all my years of travelling, I have never had a travel person treat me so badly.\" She was sent to Air Canada customer service at the airport to find a new flight to Miami. By the time she was seen by an agent, no flights were available that would allow her to make the connection. She also had to wait to get back her checked luggage. She filed a complaint for missing her \"dream vacation\" with Air Canada the next day. The $10,000 National Geographic cruise, organised by Lindblad Expeditions, tours the famous Pacific Ocean archipelago's varied islands and habitats. A spokeswoman for Lindblad Expeditions said on Friday they have been in contact with Ms Russell throughout the situation and have rebooked her expedition at no charge, including airfare from Miami to Galapagos. Air Canada confirmed that the flight had been oversold. But the carrier said their agents spent \"a great deal of time\" looking at options for Ms Russell, including exploring \"outside the box\" solutions for getting her directly to the Galapagos Islands despite her flight ticket being issued only to Miami. They noted they refunded her initial fare and paid compensation. \"This is a very regrettable situation and we are sorry this occurred,\" said an Air Canada spokesman in a statement.

South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Alan Billings said the sum was \"substantially less\" than required. The force, which has a legal duty to support its staff, said that as of January more than £12m had been paid out on legal representation. The total spend had now risen to \"considerably more than that\", it added. Dr Billings described the financial situation for the force as \"grave\" and said taxpayers in the region would \"have to bear the additional cost\". He said it would ultimately impact on the police budget and the force's ability to provide policing and crime services. Dr Billings said he would be calling an emergency meeting. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died after crushing at the FA Cup semi final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest held at Hillsborough in 1989. Fresh inquests into the deaths were ordered after the original accidental death verdicts were quashed in 2012 following an independent report. The inquests are expected to continue for another year. Dr Billings said: \"The special grant application I submitted was for the full amount, which leaves us the shortfall to pay. \"My office now has to undertake a financial analysis to establish the size of the shortfall and its impact on our budget.\" \"While I recognise that the Home Secretary's decision was a matter of discretion, I am extremely disappointed by both the timing of the announcement and the amount of funding granted.\" Dr Billings said he would submit another application to fund \"the further legal costs we will incur during 2015/16\".

But more than £100bn of extra borrowing, roughly equivalent to the entire NHS budget - nearly £60bn of that the costs of Brexit - make a brutal backdrop for Theresa May's government as it only just gets going. Remember all the figures ought to be taken with a giant pinch of salt. Forecasts like these have so often been wrong. And no one is forecasting a recession. But what the chancellor said today and the Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated have big implications. First off, with the goal of balancing the books now an aspiration to be met as \"early as possible\", next Parliament, the Tories will be going into the next election, a decade after they took charge, without having kept the central promise they made 10 years before of clearing the deficit. Yes, you read that right - a full decade. As political promises go, that is a less than glorious record. Voters will see the national debt hitting 90% of GDP, not shy of £2 trillion, 10 years after being told that tough spending cuts were worth it, because within five years we would be on our way back to the mythic sunlit uplands. There is a separate debate about whether that was ever achievable, and how much Brexit can be blamed for the fact Mr Hammond has pushed those targets back again. But at the very least, it means the Conservatives will still be borrowing, and borrowing significantly, busting their own timetable by at least five years. And with wages predicted to slow, and inflation expected to rise, the public will feel the pinch too. Simply, if today's forecasts are right, the government's finances are set to be shaky for a lot longer, and more voters will feel skint. Despite Theresa May's repeated desire to help families who are finding it hard to make ends meet, there were few measures that will make a big difference. Privately, Treasury sources acknowledge they haven't done that much, despite Number 10's hopes. The truth is that they didn't have much cash to play with. And Mr Hammond's ambitions to rebuild the fundamentals of the economy were clearly his priority, rather than major concessions to help some groups of voters feel a bit more flush\n",

Mark Wyeth QC, defending, suggested his client had the right of way as the lights on the stretch of Old Street were green.

After an investigation, the ICO said that the council's guidelines on data protection were insufficient and the chief executive committed to making improvements. An Anglesey council spokesperson said: \"In order to secure improvements, we have recently established a corporate information governance project board to embed and improve a culture of data protection compliance throughout the whole organisation.\" The 17 breaches in Powys council included five internal cases of misdirecting information, and 12 cases of sending information to the wrong address, recording wrong personal data in correspondence, and placing personal data on the council's website.

Terry met Chelsea fan Tommi last year, and when he was told of the boy's death he volunteered to pay for the service. Tommi was laid to rest near his Cambridge home in a Chelsea-blue casket bearing the club logo. Tommi, who was diagnosed with leukaemia aged three, died last month after a bone marrow transplant proved unsuccessful. More on this and other stories from Cambridgeshire Family friend Tawney Bianca Toogood contacted Terry on Instagram to tell him the boy he had been photographed with had died. When she explained the family could not afford the funeral they wanted for their son, the former England captain got in touch with the funeral parlour and covered the full £1,600 costs. Tommi's mother Ruth said she was \"overwhelmed\" by the gesture and \"very proud\" the footballer - one of her son's favourite players - remembered him. Most of the arrangements for Tommi's funeral were made by Mrs Toogood's mother Mally Beaver, and sister Chelsea. The families became friends after meeting on the cancer ward at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. \"My father battled leukaemia for just 12 weeks, but Tommi fought it for five years,\" Mrs Beaver said. \"His family found times tough and we did everything we could to help them out.\" When Tommi died the Beaver family, from the travelling community, reached out to other travellers for help. \"Roo and Kevin [Tommi's father] aren't from the community, but everyone took them to their hearts,\" Mrs Beaver said. Travellers from as far afield as Canada, Australia, Scotland, Lancaster and Harlow raised more than £4,000 to help towards \"a celebration of Tommi's life\". As well as the specially-made casket, Mrs Beaver arranged for 100 blue balloons to be released at the service, and had 100 blue roses brought over from Holland \"to make it special for him\". The extra money raised will be put towards a headstone for Tommi's grave.\n",

Anthony Andreu squared the tie 10 seconds from the end of stoppage time. Neither side managed to score in extra time, but Hibs' Kevin Thomson and Jason Cummings both had penalties saved. It was goals from teenager Cummings that had given Terry Butcher's side a 2-0 advantage over the Championship runners-up after the first leg at New Douglas Park. But it was Accies goalkeeper Kevin Cuthbert who was the hero of the return leg, parrying away two nervously struck spot kicks to spark scenes of joy among the Accies faithful and protests outside Easter Road from their angry home counterparts. The spirits of the majority of the 18,000 near-capacity crowd had already not only been dampened by a dreich Edinburgh downpour but the kind of abject display all to familiar from the men in green and white this season. And four perfect penalties from Hamilton will send shockwaves through Easter Road after a season that started with a 9-0 aggregate defeat by Malmo under one manager and ended with a run of one win in 15 games and relegation under another. They are now facing the prospect of chasing one automatic promotion spot in a Championship that will not only contain relegated neighbours Hearts but League One champions Rangers, two clubs recovering from their respective financial meltdowns. Few had given Accies, who had already come through a two-leg semi-final against Falkirk, much chance of rescuing their promotion hopes as they arrived in Edinburgh looking for a first win in four away games. However, the statistics also gave them hope - having only lost two of their last 16 games, while Hibs had not won any of their last six at home and their midweek win being their first in 14 outings. Butcher had given on-loan Notts County forward Danny Haynes another chance to show why he was capped for England at youth level by starting the 26-year-old ahead of off-form teenager Alex Harris.

The 60-year-old US actor will play Howard Beale, a TV news anchor who announces he will kill himself on air after he's told he's being sacked for declining ratings. In a famous scene, Beale implores his viewers during an on-air meltdown to shout out of the window: \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more!\" Adapted by Billy Elliot writer Lee Hall, Network will open on the National Theatre's Lyttelton stage in November. It will be directed by Ivo van Hove, whose Hedda Gabler at the NT is currently a sell-out hit. Announcing its new season on Friday, National Theatre boss Rufus Norris described Network as \"one of the greatest media satires of all time\". \"It's incredibly prescient in terms of the world today,\" he said. \"I think it will stand up in our digital world.\" The 1976 film, directed by Sidney Lumet, won four of its 10 Oscar nominations. Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway and Beatrice Straight cleaned up in three of the four acting categories while writer Paddy Chayefsky won for original screenplay. Norris said van Hove had been talking about the idea with Cranston for \"a couple of years\". \"He's got a fantastic pedigree as a stage actor,\" he said. \"It's a part that requires something compelling and special.\" Norris pointed out that Beale's \"mad as hell\" line was still being quoted at demonstrations - and had appeared on a placard held by singer Charlotte Church at a rally in 2015. Cranston won a Tony award in 2014 for his Broadway debut in Robert Schenkkan's play All the Way. He was Oscar nominated last year for Trumbo.

Speaking in the assembly, Mr Farry said that Northern Ireland was the only part of the UK actively \"disinvesting\" in higher education. The consultation process will involve a number of events and online presentations in order to seek opinion from students, university staff, unions and the wider public. Just under 40% of funding for Queen's University, Belfast (QUB) and Ulster University comes directly from Stormont's Department for Employment and Learning (DEL). However, the universities faced cuts of more than £16m in funding from DEL in 2015/16, which followed cuts in funding during previous years. Ulster University is shedding about 200 jobs in 2015/16 and 1,200 student places over the next three years, while Queen's University announced in April that it was cutting 236 jobs in 2015/16 and 1,010 student places over the next three years. Ulster University also closed a number of courses and departments including their School of Modern Languages at Coleraine, County Londonderry. The universities also draw about 30% of their annual funding from student tuition fees, which are currently £3,805 per year for students from Northern Ireland. Some students also study for degrees at further education colleges, and that budget was also reduced this year by about £12m. DEL's budget was reduced by £62m earlier this year, and its budget for higher education institutions fell from £203m to £186m, a reduction of 8.2%. Mr Farry said that, given its importance to the local economy and the fact that just under half of young people in Northern Ireland entered higher education, the status quo was no longer an option. During subsequent questions, a number of MLAs including Phil Flanagan of Sinn Féin, Jim Allister of the Tradition Unionist Voice (TUV) and Basil McCrea of NI21, expressed concern about a possible rise in tuition fees. In response, Mr Farry said that he had an \"open mind\" and that \"this is not a conversation about whether we have fees or don't have fees\". \"All options have to be on the table and fees are only one of many options facing us. This is not a done deal process.\" The consultation ends on 23 October, and Mr Farry said\n",

Shell said it is at an \"early stage\" in reviewing the claims and that the case should be heard in Nigeria. The Ogale community of about 40,000 people in Rivers State, on the coast of Nigeria, who are mainly farmers or fishermen, are some of the claimants. Their case is being handled by law firm Leigh Day. Spills since 1989 have meant they don't have clean drinking water, farmland or rivers, their claim says. It points to a November 2015 report by Amnesty International which says four spill sites Shell says it planned to clean up are still contaminated. The first court hearing at the Technology and Construction Court, held on Wednesday, found that the claimants can can lodge a case against Shell's Nigerian business, known as Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC). Shell declined to comment on the ruling. Amnesty's findings followed a 2011 report by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which found water contaminated with oil by-products including benzene, thought to be a carcinogen. It suggested a clean up, but said a \"sustainable recovery\" of the area could take up to 30 years. Shell says it has agreed a clean-up plan. \"In mid-2015 SPDC JV, along with the government, UNEP and representatives of the Ogoni community, agreed to an 18-month roadmap to fast-track the environmental clean-up and remediation of Ogoniland which includes a governance framework,\" it said in a statement. The Bille community, who are mainly fishermen and are the other party to sue, claims Shell should be liable for \"failing to protect their pipelines from damage caused by third parties\", according to Leigh Day. Pipelines in the area have been targets for thieves who steal crude oil and try to refine it locally. This has lead to more spills and damage though explosions. \"Both Bille and Ogale are areas heavily impacted by crude oil theft, pipeline sabotage and illegal refining which remain the main sources of pollution across the Niger Delta. \"Ogale is in Ogoniland and it is important to note that SPDC has produced no oil or gas in Ogoniland since 1993.

She says she fears having a connection with Israel has made other people at her university hostile towards her. \"If I ever express a viewpoint in class or on social media, I get comments, in public or private,\" she said. \"It has been hard. It's been two years of constant fighting for our freedom of speech, our rights, our wellbeing. I've missed deadlines, I've had counselling, I've had anxiety episodes,\" she said. Devora believes the BDS movement is adding to a climate of hostility against Israel on campus, which she says has turned her and other Jewish students into scapegoats. \"If you look behind the BDS lens, it calls for these things that are not peaceful. They harm Jewish students and pro-Israel students and they don't support a peaceful, atmosphere on campus.\" Support for BDS has been growing rapidly on British campuses. London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) students' union in London was one of the first to endorse the BDS, after students voted in favour in a referendum in 2015. The students' union implemented an academic boycott of Israel. The BBC found 17 students' unions have now passed motions\n",

As Voges, James Franklin and John Simpson fell to the new ball, it left them on 215-8 and Hampshire in hope of a win, with the lead at just 133. But the Middlesex tail held on and hands were shaken on a draw after tea. Middlesex were the only side to remain unbeaten over the entire 2016 season as they claimed their first title since 1993, but they looked in danger of beginning a new campaign with a loss when they got under way. Without the injured Fidel Edwards, Abbott - who took his total to 16 Division One wickets in two matches - led Hampshire's attack, with Brad Wheal (3-73) also contributing. Voges survived an lbw appeal on 29 before nightwatchman Steven Finn (16) was caught off a Wheal bouncer, but Simpson joined the former Australia Test batsman to stop any Hampshire momentum. However, with the new ball in hand, Abbott gave the hosts a glimmer of hope, having Voges caught behind and Franklin taken in the slips before Gareth Berg snared Simpson (22) for wicket-keeper Lewis McManus' fourth catch. It wasn't to be for Hampshire though as Toby Roland-Jones (25), Ollie Rayner (17 not out) and Tim Murtagh (19 not out) took Middlesex to a lead of 196 and safety at tea. Michael Carberry and Jimmy Adams were brought on to bowl, signalling their intentions to agree on a draw, which brought both sides 10 points and moved Hampshire into second place in Division One behind Surrey. Hampshire captain James Vince told BBC Radio Solent: \"The way the guys fought back from Middlesex being 220-2 in their first innings to get into a position where we were really close to being able to chase a gettable score on that wicket is an incredible effort from everyone. \"The bowlers, having lost Fidel early in the first innings, were outstanding to put in a shift to get us into that position. \"We did exactly what we wanted with the new ball and came within one wicket of probably setting up a 150-run chase in 40-od\n",

Under the hashtag #RIPTwitter, thousands, perhaps millions, told the world that this was the end of civilisation as we know it, that a beautiful thing was being crushed, that the company, whose share price has been tumbling for months, was signing its own death warrant. Finally, the CEO Jack Dorsey was forced to react. \"Hello Twitter!\" he called out. \"Regarding #RIPTwitter: I want you all to know we're always listening. We never planned to reorder timelines next week.\" He went on \"Twitter is live. Twitter is real-time. Twitter is about who & what you follow. And Twitter is here to stay! By becoming more Twitter-y.\" But was Dorsey right to blink in the face of pressure? And should he be \"always listening\" to his users? That depends on whether you believe the hoariest old cliche of management books: \"The customer is always right.\" I certainly sympathise with those who say that Twitter isn't broken, so it does not need the kind of radical fixing implied by an algorithmic timeline. For me, it works just fine, connecting me to like-minded communities of dog-owners, sourdough loaf bakers, and gadget enthusiasts, while providing the best breaking news service on the planet. Like many other heavy users of Twitter, I have been sniffy about recent innovations such as \"Moments\" and would rather things carried on just as they are. But perhaps Mr Dorsey and his management team should not be listening to people like me - we're almost certainly going nowhere. He has to cock an ear to the concerns of three other constituencies - investors, advertisers and the people who use Twitter infrequently or not at all. Because the crisis in his company is not about revenues, which are growing nicely, and it's not about what loyal users think - it is about growth. The last set of results showed Twitter user numbers had barely moved over the previous three months, up just four million. Investors\n",

There are many hurdles ahead, probably thousands of hours of debate here, years of negotiations for Theresa May with our friends and rivals around the EU, as she seeks a deal - and possibly as long as a decade of administrative adjustments, as the country extricates itself from the EU. On a wet Wednesday, the debate didn't feel epoch-making, but think for a moment about what has just happened. MPs, most of whom wanted to stay in the EU, have just agreed that we are off. This time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero.

But, intensive care expert Dr Jasmeet Soar said he had not found \"a medical explanation for that\". He said Kevin's heart was likely to have stopped after 15:30 following an unsuccessful resuscitation attempt. The teenager was one of 96 people who died following a crush at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989. Kevin's mother Anne campaigned for more than 20 years for a new inquest into his death, but died before the current hearings began. Dr Stefan Popper, the coroner who oversaw the original Hillsborough inquests in the early 1990s, ruled all those who died had suffered fatal injuries by 15:15. As such, he said, he did not need to hear evidence on any events after that time. It was, according to the current coroner Sir John Goldring, a \"highly controversial decision\", which the bereaved families \"strongly disputed\". The new jurors have heard how the 15:15 cut-off meant the first inquests did not look into whether the police, ambulance service and others handled the aftermath of the disaster properly. They have now heard evidence that some of the 96 may have been alive after 15:15, with one expert witness saying there was a \"strong possibility\" Jimmy Hennessy was alive on the pitch between 15:15 and 15:20 that day. Dr Soar, an expert in intensive care medicine and resuscitation, was asked to give his opinion of what happened to Kevin based on the evidence heard about the teenager's movements. The jury saw how Kevin was carried out of pen three at 15:28, at which point Dr Soar said he was \"deeply unconscious\", \"unresponsive to stimulation\" and did not appear to have \"any body tone or muscle tone\", which was \"significant\" because it indicated he was not conscious. Kevin was carried on a makeshift stretcher to the opposite end of the pitch, where a group of Liverpool fans and medics tried to resuscitate him after 15:32.

He took office earlier this year promising to lead the country out of its worst recession in many decades. Protests against the measure turned violent in the capital Brasilia and at least a dozen states in the country. The opposition says the measures will mainly hit areas such as health and education, which are already underfunded. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets during the Senate session to protest against the austerity plan. After the vote, many demonstrations descended into violence. In Brasilia, masked protesters set fire to a bus and marched on the local offices of Globo TV, which they say is biased towards Mr Temer's government. But the marchers were blocked by riot police. In Sao Paulo, the headquarters of the state's conservative Industrial Federation (Fiesp) was attacked. To pass the constitutional amendment, the government needed the votes of 49 senators - three-fifths of the Senate. The measure was approved by a narrower margin than the government expected, passing by 53 to 19 votes. \"We have won. That was the main thing: to deliver the product in the middle of a storm,\" said government leader in the Senate Romero Juca. The project, known in Brazil as PEC 55, freezes expenditure in the executive, judiciary and legislative branches of power, allowing them to grow only by the rate of inflation n the previous year. The government argues it is necessary to boost growth and investments, and contain the country's growing public deficit.

The steady rise in value is believed to be linked to policy changes in Japan and China that have made it easier for speculators to trade in bitcoins. Many other virtual currencies have also enjoyed a sustained rise in value over the last few weeks. Bitcoin first broke the $1,000 (£768) barrier in November 2013 but its value has fluctuated wildly since then. For instance, in early 2014 one bitcoin was worth only $280 (£215). And at the end of 2016, each one was changing hands for about $900 (£690). Bitcoin emerged in 2008 and is a digital currency based around cryptography. Individual coins can be split into smaller denominations and many people involved with the currency use computers to verify the globally-held log, known as the blockchain, of who spent what where. Verifying transactions involves solving a complicated mathematical problem and the first person to do so gets rewarded with bitcoins. Rising interest in bitcoin has sparked the creation of many other crypto-currencies. These have proved popular as the technology underlying bitcoin has struggled to cope with its popularity and growth. One estimate suggests bitcoins now make up only 47% of all traded crypto-currencies. Rivals such as Ethereum and Ripple have been gaining value far faster than bitcoin over the last few months. The surging valuations has led some commentators to suggest that an unsustainable crypto-currency bubble is developing. \"The question is not if but when the market will turn,\" said an editorial in The Economist.\n",

But researchers say there is a \"reality gap\" between safeguards designed to help affected communities and who actually receives the compensation. The findings have been published online in Global Environment Change. \"About 11% of global emissions come from deforestation and degradation of tropical forests so the idea is that if you can slow this down then that can offset emissions and that is good for climate mitigation,\" explained Julia Jones from Bangor University, Wales. Over the past decade, schemes called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (Redd/Redd+) have been developed as part of the global effort to mitigate climate change. These mechanisms are designed to improve forest management and reduce the net emission of greenhouse gases in tropical forest and sub-tropical forest nations. \"It finally got approval (at the UN climate summit) in Paris in December that Redd+ will go ahead as a global climate mitigation mechanism,\" Prof Jones told BBC News. \"What that means in reality is more protected areas and more funding. This sounds brilliant, after all it is a win-win situation and what is there not to like about it?\" However, it has been widely acknowledged that such schemes - if not implemented properly - can have a significant negative impact on people's livelihoods, such as indigenous communities, and exacerbate poverty. \"This has been taken on board by, for example, the World Bank,\" observed Prof Jones. \"They have made commitments that anything they fund [and] people are displaced as a result, they must be compensated for it. \"These commitments are also encapsulated in other doctrines, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity.\" But she added: \"The problem is how do you go about doing that? The way that the World Bank guidelines work is that households affected by a scheme must be identified and then compensated for the negative impact of the establishment of a protected area on their livelihoods.\" In order to test whether the commitment to \"social safeguards\" were working on the ground, the team of UK and Madagascan researchers looked in detail at an area within Madagascar where a new protected area was being established.

He was allegedly paid more than £10,000 for 40 tips to reporter Stephen Moyes between 30 April 2006 and 1 May 2011. Mr Norman, of Swanscombe, Kent, denies the charge against him. Opening the case at the Old Bailey, prosecutor Julian Christopher QC said Mr Norman was an \"extremely experienced\" prison officer and a member of the Prison Officers Association, acting as union representative to colleagues. The court heard Mr Norman first phoned the Daily Mirror in 2006 and gave Mr Moyes a story about staff cuts at the prison, for which he was paid £400. The exclusive story described Belmarsh as a \"terror prison\" and ran alongside a photograph of one of its most notorious prisoners, radical preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri, the court heard. As the relationship developed, it became a \"two-way affair\" and Mr Norman carried on dealing with Mr Moyes when the journalist moved to the News of the World, the court heard. Mr Christopher said: \"Sometimes Robert Norman would approach Stephen Moyes with something he thought would be of interest, at other times Stephen Moyes would approach Robert Norman for inside information about a topic in which he was interested, or for confirmation which he would not be able to get for free from the official channels at the Ministry of Justice press office. \"Effectively, Robert Norman became the journalist's paid mole within HMP Belmarsh.\" The court heard that when Mr Norman was arrested in 2013 he maintained he had acted in the public interest as a whistleblower. Cheques for the stories were made out to Mr Norman's son Daniel and the money was then transferred into Mr Norman's account, showing he was \"worried about the trouble he would get into\" if found out, Mr Christopher said.

It's not hard to see why. Nostalgia is part of it, these being the remnants of a once great and noble industry, around which large parts of Lanarkshire was built. It's partly because Clydebridge and Dalzell are symbolic of the impact of globalisation, forcing transition on workers and communities at a local level as the price of enriching the broader economy. Other parts of Britain and Europe feel the strain of in-migrating people. In Motherwell and Cambuslang, the concern is about out-migrating jobs. But it's also because there's discomfort that the new economy and the new labour market is unplanned and haphazard, buffeted by market forces and lacking in the security of big plants with jobs-for-life. It is not always easy to appreciate that Britain has grown quite successfully in recent years by retreating from the making of things. The service sector makes up 75% of the economy, and while it ranges from high-value finance and professional roles to burger-flipping and care homes, it lacks that noble quality with which the old heavy (and dirty) industries are seen in hindsight. There is widespread agreement that Britain needs to think again about manufacturing. On the freer market end of things, George Osborne coined the evocative ambition for there to be a \"march of the makers\". The rhetoric hasn't always matched the policy outcomes. Industrial policy at Westminster now consists of a push towards a more technically literate workforce, and incentives aimed at 11 chosen sectors, ranging across aerospace and automotive to nuclear and wind power, life sciences and professional and business services. There are also 'catapult centres' for propelling ideas towards the market in robotics, synthetic biology and better batteries. If you want to see what British manufacturing looks like these days (under German management and with a lot of robots), I'd highly recommend 'Building Cars Live' on the BBC iPlayer for two more weeks.

He said paramedics arrived at around 18:00 local time (17:00 BST) but were unable to save her.

An investigation by the newspaper found major brands were appearing next to YouTube videos promoting extremist views - generating revenues for the creators. The company has apologised and promised better tools for advertisers. Despite Google’s efforts to contain the row, which began in the UK earlier this week, it appears to have now caught the attention of the US advertising industry - creating a huge problem for Google as it seeks to reassure brands their ad spend is not funding hate groups. According to The Times, Verizon’s advertisements were appearing along side videos made by Wagdi Ghoneim, an Egyptian cleric who had been banned from the US over extremism, and Hanif Qureshi, whose teachings inspired the assassination of a Pakistani politician. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” AT&T said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” The UK-based investigation led more than 250 brands to pull their advertising. In a blog post published on Monday, Google’s chief business officer Philipp Schindler announced the company was expanding its policies on hate speech to include videos targeting vulnerable groups. In response to the latest boycott from the US brands, Google said on Wednesday: “We’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear.” “We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” Google is the dominant player in online advertising, and ads are by far the company’s biggest source of money. In 2016, the firm generated $80bn in ad revenue - accounting for almost 90% of the firm’s total income for the year.

Growth of the trees is still restricted more than 30 years later, a study in the journal Functional Ecology said. The more drought-tolerant Sessile Oak survived better and is now dominating the beech. The scientific work was carried out at Lady Wood Park in the Wye Valley. This 45 hectare (111 acre) site is a national nature reserve and is attractive to researchers because it has been deliberately unmanaged since 1945. Detailed forest surveys have been carried out in the park over the past 70 years and the ecologists were able to use these along with tree ring data to discover how the different tree species fared over the period. Before 1976, beech was the dominant species in this area. But that summer's drought has permanently changed the makeup of the forest. That dry spell was the most exceptional drought in the years between 1914 and 2006 - it was 30% more intense than the next driest year, 1921. The researchers found that in the period immediately after 1976, there was a significant growth in beech mortality. Between 1977 and 1992, 17% of these trees died, while there were no deaths among the oaks. \"The beech growth dropped very suddenly,\" said Prof Alistair Jump from the University of Stirling who carried out the work along with researchers from Joint Nature Conservation Committee. \"The Sessile Oak which is slightly less competitive but is more drought tolerant took advantage and grew much better - and beech has never fully recovered in the system.\" The researchers say the oaks increased their growth rate by approximately 20% in the years immediately after 1976. The beech trees eventually stabilised their growth rate but only at around 75% of pre-drought levels. The scientists say that beech trees can appear to tolerate drought without a long term impact until a threshold is reached. \"I think tipping point is a key idea, and that's something that we see very clearly in the work,\" said Prof Jump. \"They are resistant up to a point and then we hit a tipping point and the system shows very severe impacts. The problem is we don't know where these tipping points are for other species.\" The researchers say they expect the changes that they recorded at Lady Park Wood\n",

At least 15 people are still missing after the avalanche that came after several earthquakes and heavy snowfall. While one more survivor has yet to be rescued, Italian media said other voices may have been heard in the ruins during the night. Five people have been confirmed dead. The first five survivors were taken to safety on Friday, some 40 hours after the avalanche hit on Wednesday. They had reportedly taken refuge beneath a collapsed portion of ceiling, where they were able to light a fire to keep warm for two days. The rescue has been hampered by deep snow blocking an access road. There are also concerns that further avalanches could follow, Italian newspaper La Stampa reported. The first person pulled out on Friday was an eight-year-old boy, the son of a holidaymaker, Giampiero Parete, who had gone to his car when the avalanche struck and first sounded the alarm by calling his boss. The boy's mother, Adriana, was pulled out next, telling rescue workers her six-year-old daughter was still trapped inside. The little girl was also later saved and the family was reunited at a hospital in the coastal town of Pescara. Hospital officials told the Associated Press news agency they had symptoms of hypothermia and dehydration, but were otherwise in good health.

The Rainforest Alliance, an ethical certification organisation, has now stripped a group of Assam Company's plantations of its green frog seal. The Assam Company said it was appealing against the decision. A group of Assam Company's estates lost its certification because \"it was found to be in breach of critical criteria relating to the use of personal protective equipment\", the Rainforest Alliance said in a statement. The Assam Company said the loss of its certification was because of a \"minor error\" on one estate - Hajua - while spraying a plant extract, which it understood did not require personal protective equipment. It said that because the Assam company estates operate in a \"single cluster\", the other estates were automatically decertified. Twinings, Taylors of Harrogate and Fortnum & Mason have suspended business with the company while Harrods took the tea off its shelves shortly after the investigation, which was broadcast in September. Workers at the company's Hajua estate were seen spraying agrochemicals without the protective equipment employers are required to provide, when the BBC visited. Men spraying reported breathing difficulties, numbness of the hands and face, a burning sensation on the skin and profound loss of appetite. The Rainforest Alliance said its auditor confirmed the BBC's evidence of unsafe spraying and the organisation had tightened its rules on the subject. Taylors of Harrogate said it will maintain a relationship with the estates and support efforts to improve standards. Twinings plans to continue working with the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP) - an organisation set up by UK tea companies to improve workers' lives - to monitor the working and living conditions on all the tea estates from which it buys. It also plans to conduct a review of the Assam estates it sources from in the next few months.

Together with 85 from skipper Alastair Cook, Bairstow's third ton in six Tests dragged the hosts out of a hole in near-perfect conditions for batting. Rash strokeplay mixed with disciplined bowling from Sri Lanka had reduced Cook's men to 84-4 just after lunch. But Bairstow profited from a dropped catch and then the most marginal of lbw decisions to continue his wonderful early summer run of form. Not since beating India 4-0 in the summer of 2011 have England whitewashed a Test opponent in a series of three or more matches. And while the weather forecast for the remainder of the match is uncertain, Bairstow's fightback has given them a hold in a contest that had been drifting Sri Lanka's way. Media playback is not supported on this device While England have improved both in style and substance over the course of the last year, serious flaws remain - and the vulnerability of the top order is the most pressing of all.

            "Input: summarize: Southgate was delighted with aspects of England's display in defeat in the friendly against Germany in Dortmund on Wednesday while the unspectacular win against Lithuania was all about getting three more points towards World Cup qualification. So what will Southgate take away from the last week as England look ahead to their next qualifier in Scotland on 10 June? Southgate set the normal rules about strikers and age aside to bring 34-year-old Jermain Defoe back into the England fold four years after his last goal for his country, scored in a victory against San Marino. Injuries to main striker Harry Kane and all-time record goalscorer Wayne Rooney forced Southgate's hand but he was able to call on the hard evidence provided by Defoe's 14 Premier League goals in a Sunderland side renowned for not making chances and rooted to the bottom of the table. Defoe has always traded in the game's most important currency, goals, throughout his lengthy career. This was a performance designed to demonstrate to doubters and Southgate he has not outlived his usefulness at international level. He was sharp and saw one chance saved before he demonstrated his poacher's instinct in the penalty area to slide in Adam Lallana's pass in the 21st minute before flashing another shot narrowly off target. In many respects he is an old-fashioned attacking operator in that his first thought is always the back of the net and shooting at it. No extra touches or passes are required. Defoe had two shots on target, one off target and one blocked with very limited opportunities - but most significantly made England's breakthrough. He is selfish in just the right way and in a World Cup qualifying group where England will be confronted by the sort of mass defence Lithuania presented here, it is unlikely this will be a temporary return to the colours. Dele Alli was given heavy-handed - or more precisely heavy-footed - treatment from Lithuania as they tried to light the short fuse that has brought Tottenham's 20-year-old some unsavoury headlines in his short career. It meant Alli was nowhere near as influential as he was in Dortmund on Wednesday, where his efforts will have imprinted his importance for both the present and the future in Southgate's mind.

But the team behind the discovery has now come back with a deeper analysis. It tells Science magazine that features seen in the brain, feet, hands and pelvis of A. sediba all suggest this species was on the direct evolutionary line to us - Homo sapiens. \"We have examined the critical areas of anatomy that have been used consistently for identifying the uniqueness of human beings,\" said Professor Lee Berger from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg \"Any one of these features could have evolved separately, but it is highly unlikely that all of them would have evolved together if A. sediba was not related to our lineage,\" the team leader informed BBC News. It is a big claim and, if correct, would sideline other candidates in the fossil record for which similar assertions have been made in the past. Theory holds that modern humans can trace a line back to a creature known as Homo erectus which lived more than a million years ago. This animal, according to many palaeoanthropologists, may in turn have had its origins in more primitive hominins, as they are known, such as Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. The contention now made for A. sediba is that, although older than its \"rivals\", some of its anatomy and capabilities were more advanced than these younger forms. Put simply, it is a more credible ancestor for H. erectus, Berger's team claims. The sediba specimens were unearthed at Malapa in the famous Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site, just to the northwest of Jo'burg. They were pulled from a pit - a depression left in the ground by a cave complex that had lost its roof through erosion over time. Identified as an adult female and a juvenile male, the two individuals were quite possibly mother and son. What seems certain is that they died together in some tragic accident that saw them either fall into the cave complex or become stuck in it. After death, their bodies were washed into a pool and cemented in\n",

And if you stand inside the tiny cell where South Africa's struggle icon spent 18 years hidden from the world, and peer through the barred window into the high-walled courtyard, you can just make out the thin strip of green and brown foliage where he once tended tomatoes and chillies. \"A garden was one of the few things in prison that one could controlâ€ The sense of being the custodian of this small patch of earth offered a small taste of freedom,\" Mr Mandela wrote in his autobiography, Long Walk To Freedom - an early draft of which, incidentally, he tried to hide from the prison guards by burying in the garden. Today, the garden's weeds - and the rotting stump of an apple tree - hint at the alleged mismanagement and corruption that have blighted Robben Island for years. But along one wall, two grape vines now stand out in sharp contrast - the lush green foliage of a promising harvest suspended on a wooden frame. \"They're still growing, thriving, regardless of the difficult conditions on the island. They're very much a symbol of the resilience of the leaders imprisoned here,\" said Philip Jonker, a South African wine maker as he and two colleagues carefully pruned the vines by hand. It is seven years since Mr Jonker first spotted the two plants on a family visit to the island. It is not clear whether Mr Mandela himself tended the vines or whether, as seems more likely, they were planted shortly after he was transferred to another prison on the mainland. But Mr Jonker sees them - there are seven vines around the prison in total - as part of the island's heritage, and a way of preserving \"South African history in a bottle\". After four years of petitioning, he finally secured permission to tend the vines, and, last year, to take the first harvest - previous ones had been devoured by the island's ravenous birds - back to his Weltevrede family wine estate two hours' drive east of Cape Town.

Source: ESPN Cricinfo \"I'm very much an introverted person. I like my own company, my own family. I don't really go out much. \"I think the confidence has grown from what I've achieved on the cricket field but I'm not as confident as anybody thinks.\" The disarming revelation is one of many in Pietersen's fascinating chat with Flintoff, a player with whom he occasionally clashed during the years they shared an England dressing room. In it, Pietersen talks about growing up in South Africa unaware of what the Ashes were, his see-saw relationship with Shane Warne, his ill-fated spell as captain and his regret over the silly shots that have left him looking \"a complete mug\" at times. He opens up about England captains past and present, relives the anguish of injuries and loss of form and reaffirms his ambition to clock up 10,000 Test runs. Like many top sportsmen, Pietersen is public property, someone we think we know much better than we actually do. This interview goes behind the bling and the bravado to reveal an insecurity over his image, a recognition of his faults, a light-heartedness - he calls Flintoff \"chubby\" at one point - and perhaps less surprisingly, an absolute obsession with his performance on the field of play. After leaving South Africa in protest against the racial quota system - which insisted on a certain number of non-white players in every team - and qualifying to play for England through the Kolpak rule, Pietersen announced himself with three one-day centuries against the country of his birth in early 2005.

They have threatened to occupy parts of the city if their demands are not met. Public discontent in Hong Kong is at its highest for years with concern over Beijing's influence over elections. The city's police estimated Sunday's turnout at more than 110,000 people, but a specialist polling group based at the University of Hong Kong put the figure at around 80,000. \"We want to let the world know that we want peace, we want democracy, but please, do not threaten us, do not try to turn this place into a place of violence,\" Robert Chow, co-founder of the pro-government Alliance for Peace and Democracy told AFP. Political rallies are a common sight in Hong Kong, a special Chinese city with a high level of freedom. But large-scale demonstrations supportive of the Chinese government in Beijing are extremely rare. The demonstrators -- much older than their pro-democracy rivals and clearly mobilised by dozens of pro-China clan organisations -- carried signs opposing the civil disobedience movement called Occupy Central. Questions have been raised about the legitimacy of the demonstration. Hong Kong media reports have suggested some companies and business groups had asked their employees to take part. Despite those controversies, Johnson Yeung, a pro-democracy activist who organised the recent 1 July protest, told BBC News the rally was indeed an historic event. \"For the first time since the handover in 1997, the central government has organised a mass rally of this scale. It really shows their commitment against Occupy Central.\" The large turnout is a reminder there is still no consensus in the battle for Hong Kong's political future. In the other camp, pro-democracy activists from the \"Occupy Central\" group have said they would mobilise protesters to take over some of the busier areas of the central business district if electoral reform is not put in place. City authorities say such an occupation would be illegal however, and argue that it could tarnish Hong Kong's reputation. Hong Kong's next elections will take place in 2017, and China says it will introduce universal suffrage for the vote. However\n",

It blamed a drop in traffic for price comparison sites on Amazon and others. Europe's competition commissioner first accused the firm of abusing its dominance in search in April 2015 and made further claims in July 2016. Google's shopping results appear as a box of images and links displayed alongside other search results. In 2015, the EU competition commissioner claimed these results gave prominence to Google's own services and advertisements, to the detriment of price comparison websites, which may have lost visitors. Google responded that the EU had failed to take into account the significance of online shopping giants such as Amazon, which it said also competed against price comparison websites. In its updated claim, the EU said Amazon could not be considered a rival to price comparison websites because it sometimes paid such sites to be included in search results. Google's latest response says websites such as Amazon get a \"tiny fraction\" of their visitors from price comparison websites, \"hardly enough to support the idea that they don't compete\" with one another. It also pointed out that Amazon provides its own price comparison tools for its customers. \"The commission's revised case still rests on a theory that just doesn't fit the reality of how most people shop online,\" the company said in a blog. \"It's not surprising that when Amazon and other new competitors arrived in European countries, traffic to sites offering only price comparison went down.\" The company said it would \"look forward\" to continuing discussions with the commission. FairSearch Europe - a lobby group that was one of the complainants against Google - said Google's actions were \"anti-consumer\".

But I was there to make a documentary about Europe dancing to a worrying tune - popular discontent, fear, anger and, in many corners, an absence of hope. There is always a section in society that feels abandoned or ignored by their government, but after the 2008 crash, the bank bailouts, the migrant crises and a string of terror attacks, a growing number of Europeans have felt unprotected, exposed and worried for the future of their families. And the answer to their fears? Well if my Fiat 500 were Europe - bear with me on this one - it would be hesitating at a crossroads. The signpost pointing one way reads Angela Merkel. And in the opposite direction, Marine Le Pen. These two determined women, tough and seasoned politicians, both standing for election this year, hope to drag their own countries and Europe as a whole down dramatically different paths. A passionate European and Christian Democrat, mindful of the horrors of her country's Nazi and Cold War past, Ms Merkel is increasingly viewed as the continent's number one defender of liberal values. Barack Obama pointedly chose to visit her in Berlin on his last official trip abroad before handing over the presidency to Donald Trump. Ms Le Pen, on the other hand, is the poster child of Europe's new wave of populism. She demands what she described to me in an interview as a \"new world order\". A new France, a new Europe, free, she says, of the \"prison\" of the European Union and the \"artificial\" joining of European nations. She laughed at those wringing their hands on both sides of the Atlantic over the Trump Presidency. Brexit, Trump and Europe's new \"patriotic leaders\" in Ms Le Pen's words, are merely the end of one world and the start of a new one where, in her opinion, the people and the nation state are strong and don't answer to what she called \"Globalisationists\". Gone are the days in the not so distant past when national elections met a wall of public indifference - 2017 has been dubbed 'Election Year' in Europe\n",

And then two years later, it struck gold again, finding yet another giant oil reserve. Optimism was running high. The firm went to the markets and raised over $70bn - the world's largest share issue ever. Brazil's economy was at cruising speed too, finally taking off after years of meagre growth. But the good times did not last long - for neither the company nor the country. A massive corruption scandal last year eroded much of Petrobras's market value. Brazil's economy too has been on a downward spiral - with high inflation, slow growth and low confidence. So how did it all go so wrong, so fast? Petrobras's oil bonanza and Brazil's emerging star status are fairly recent phenomena. Just a few decades ago, prospects were dire for both. In the early 1990s, Brazil was a young democracy in deep economic trouble. Annualised inflation was running close to 5,000%. Decades of protectionism meant there was little competition in most sectors and many national firms had become inefficient. Petrobras was seen as part of that landscape by many who wanted to privatise it. One critic used to refer to it as \"Petrossauro\" - a large, outdated structure that moved slowly and was doomed to extinction in the modern world. Brazil's fortunes started to change in the mid-1990s - both internally and externally. Through reforms, successive governments were able to defeat hyperinflation, open up Brazil's economy to the world and redistribute growth, lifting millions out of poverty. A decade of global economic boom favoured Brazil's champion exports - commodities like coffee, soya, beef and oil. Brazil's oil sector was opened to foreign companies, but local laws made sure Petrobras kept its role at the top of every major project. A decade of high international oil prices helped give a great boost to the firm's investment plans. By 2010 - after all oil discoveries - it felt like Brazil and Petrobras had finally \"arrived\" at the top. But then things took a turn for the worse. One problem was Petrobras\n",

Those charges have now been dropped. A spokeswoman for the district attorney in New York's Queen's district told US media the case would be dismissed because of insufficient evidence. Mr LaBeouf's art project, a 24-hour live stream called He Will Not Divide Us, encouraged members of the public to say those words into a camera outside New York's Museum of the Moving Image. But Mr LaBeouf and a member of the public allegedly entered an altercation during a live broadcast in January. The museum later said the site had become \"a flashpoint for violence\". The live stream was planned to continue for the four years of Mr Trump's presidency, but the museum pulled support for the project in early February. The project was forced to move location twice in the US, after opponents tried to disrupt it. It then arrived in a new form in Liverpool in the UK - but faced similar problems.

In a statement, the Secret Service said it was \"extremely disappointed and angry\" about the events of 10 March. Mr Tran did not gain entry to the White House, where President Donald Trump was staying at the time. However, Congressman Jason Chaffetz - whose House Oversight Committee oversees the Secret Service - claimed the intruder had managed to rattle a door-handle at the South Portico entrance. According to court documents, Mr Tran told federal agents that he was a friend of the president and had an appointment. He was carrying two cans of mace, a US passport, a computer and one of Mr Trump's books, authorities said. The president praised the Secret Service for doing a \"fantastic job\" in apprehending the intruder. Mr Tran had managed to climb a 5ft (1.5m) fence near the US Treasury Department, which is next to the White House. He then scaled an 8ft vehicle gate, and a shorter fence near the east wing of the White House grounds. CNN reports that he set off several alarms after jumping the fence, but was able to avoid other sensors. Mr Tran, who comes from Milpitas, California, had reportedly been spotted \"looming around\" Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue, where the White House stands, nearly six hours before his arrest.

The Sar-e-Pol provincial governor said that a number of security force vehicles were destroyed. Earlier a civilian was killed in a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. Villagers also accused Nato of killing seven civilians, including a nine-year-old child, in an air strike in eastern Paktia province. They were the first people reported killed in air strikes since the new government was installed at the end of September. However, Nato said Sunday's strike had killed \"eight armed enemy combatants\". The issue of Nato air strikes was the most contentious of the many disputes that former President Hamid Karzai had with the international community, reports the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul.

It wants Italy to destroy infected trees and restrict any trade in species vulnerable to the disease. New emergency measures are to be proposed by the Commission this week. Thousands of hectares of olives are affected by the outbreak - a major worry for Italy, which is the EU's second biggest olive oil producer after Spain. The Commission set out a range of measures to contain the outbreak last July, but says the situation has deteriorated since then and more action is needed. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) says the disease, which kills trees by desiccation, is spread by various sap-sucking insects. An EFSA spokesperson told the BBC that there remain \"a lot of uncertainties\" about the Italian outbreak, despite a comprehensive EFSA study of it published in January. \"Even trees not showing symptoms might carry the bacteria, which makes it really difficult. Just cutting down trees with symptoms might not be enough,\" he said. Italian officials in Lecce say 15km-wide (nine-mile) buffer strips will be created around plantations which have infected trees. Those strips should be free of species vulnerable to the disease, so that the blight is contained. Local officials, quoted by Italy's AGI news agency, suspect the disease entered Italy through ornamental plants imported from Costa Rica. The Xylella blight has previously ravaged vineyards in California and citrus groves in Brazil, EFSA says. A local campaign group called Peacelink disputes the EU data on the disease, however, arguing that a fungal infection is most likely to blame. In a letter to EU Health and Food Safety Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis, Peacelink says more than 500 olive trees treated for fungi have recovered since spring last year. It says research by the University of Foggia pointed to fungi, rather than Xylella, as the cause. Peacelink urged the EU not to destroy olive trees en masse in the affected area, saying such a move would be \"totally unnecessary\".\n",

In 2014, it made a net profit of £216m selling its pharmacy chain and farms. Chief executive Richard Pennycock said without the proceeds of the sales the group would have, \"at best, broken even\".

Mrs Wadsworth and her husband Tony are on trial accused of indecently assaulting seven boys in the 1990s. The couple deny the offences and charges of outraging public decency. Mrs Wadsworth's barrister, David Hislop QC, criticised the prosecutions use of a \"Naughty but Nice\" charity calendar, in which Mrs Wadsworth posed as Lady Godiva, to suggest her career was forged \"on the twang of a stocking\". He suggested the prosecution used the calendar because of \"shortcomings in their evidence\". Mr Hislop claimed that prejudice and emotion had infected the investigation into allegations against the couple who previously worked for BBC Leicester and Birmingham-based BBC WM. He stressed to the jury that Mrs Wadsworth was not on trial to assess her morals. She accepts having sexual encounters with \"young men\" but denies they were underage. The couple, from Broughton Astley in Leicestershire, are charged with five counts of outraging public decency alleging they engaged in sexual activity \"against a tree\" in woodland in Warwickshire in view of others between July 1992 and June 1996. They deny the charges. Mrs Wadsworth has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of indecent assault, while her husband denies nine counts of the same offence. The trial continues.\n",

Bolasie added a second soon afterwards as he poked the ball past Costel Pantilimon after Murray's knockdown. A lofted finish from Bolasie made it 3-0 and he completed his treble from Murray's pass before Connor Wickham volleyed in a late consolation. The result, the second time in three home games that Sunderland have conceded four goals, increases the Black Cats' relegation fears.

Sunderland have only six games left to save themselves, but their last two matches of the season are away at Arsenal and then at current leaders Chelsea. Dick Advocaat, brought in after former manager Gus Poyet had been sacked following a 4-0 home defeat by Aston Villa, had stressed the importance of this match to his side. But he was let down by some woeful defending as the hosts capitulated and conceded four goals in a 14-minute spell early in the second half. After a quiet first half that was low on quality and goalscoring chances, but high on fierce challenges, the match sprung into life within three minutes of the restart. Murray headed in his sixth goal in six games to set Palace on their way to their eighth win in 12 Premier League games since Alan Pardew took over at the start of the January. But even he could not have expected what was to follow. The hosts fell apart and three minutes later Bolasie, with one goal in his previous 27 league matches this season, got to Murray's flick-on first to make it 2-0.

The speech will be the first made to a full meeting of the Parliament by a Canadian PM. New Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen will also make his first address to MEPs on Tuesday. As well as that, MEPs are due to vote on new legislation relating to border checks and terrorist offences. They will also vote on a motion setting out their position on where the EU should go after Brexit. Here are the main events coming up in the week ahead... The sitting will kick off in the afternoon with a debate on ways to promote greater use of natural pesticides in European farming. In a motion on Wednesday, MEPs are likely to call for current EU authorisation rules for such pesticides to be eased. The day's main debate is on suggestions for improving the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS), a scheme which aims to reduce carbon emissions. The scheme works by making large power plants buy \"allowances\" authorising them to emit greenhouse gases, within an overall agreed limit. Critics of the system say it is ineffective because the price of permits is too low and the overall cap has become overly generous due to lower economic activity. The EU Commission has proposed to increase the speed at which emissions permits are withdrawn from the market in the nine years running up to 2030. MEPs will take a position on the changes on Wednesday, although the necessary agreement from EU governments on where to go from here has not yet been found.

A Football Association statement on Thursday said: \"The FA can confirm that it has given Notts County Ladies players the opportunity to move to new clubs within England with immediate effect. \"Following Notts County's decision last week to terminate its women's team, the FA has worked closely with the PFA and wider stakeholders to enable players to find new clubs as soon as possible. \"Players are now in a position to sign for new clubs in England. They may also move to leagues in other countries where the transfer window is open.\" A statement from the Professional Footballers' Association on Friday had said: \"We have also been in discussions with the FA and FAWSL to ensure that players can register with other clubs outside of the transfer window given the exceptional circumstances the players find themselves in due to no fault of their own.\" What remains unclear is how many WSL clubs will have contingency within their budgets for the Spring Series to sign additional players.\n",

Universities Minister Jo Johnson said the sale would have \"no impact on people with student loans\". But the National Union of Students said it was an \"ugly move on students\". \"It is outrageous that bankers will profit off the backs of graduates who took out loans because they had no other option,\" said the union's vice-president Sorana Vieru. The government has had a long-standing aim to sell the student loan book to private investors - with types of loans being sold in separate stages. Over the next four years it aims to dispose of the loans from before 2012, when tuition fees in England were trebled to £9,000 per year. The slice of loans now being put on sale - dating from 2002 to 2006 - have a face value of £4bn. The government is promising that there will be \"no changes to the terms and conditions\" for borrowers - so that rates of repayment for former students will remain the same. It means that interest on these student loans will become an income for private investors, but repayments will continue to be collected through taxation and the Student Loans Company. The Intergenerational Foundation think tank has calculated that a student borrowing for three years' tuition could pay back £54,000 - before debts are cancelled after 30 years. The Universities Minister Jo Johnson says the sale of assets is part of the drive to bring \"public finances under control\". But he said it would \"only proceed once we are satisfied that it represents value for money for the taxpayer\". David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, said it was the right time to start the sale process. \"This sale makes sense for taxpayers and will play an important contribution in our work to repair the public finances,\" he said. But John Pugh, the Liberal Democrats education spokesman, said: \"The Conservative Brexit fire-sale is well underway, as ministers scrabble around to sell just about anything that isn't nailed down.\" Earlier versions of student loans have previously been sold - but it is now approaching the point in which the bigger \"income-contingent loans\", introduced in 2006 when fees rose to £3,000, will be the\n",

            "Input: summarize: It was widely anticipated the Spending Review would confirm the need for police efficiencies would remain at the top of the agenda, at least until 2020. The Home Office is not one of the favoured \"protected\" ministries shielded from cuts. And as 71% of its gross spending goes on crime and policing, that is where most of the department's cuts have bitten. Add to that Home Secretary Theresa May's determination to reform policing, and there was a strong sense the government would not change course. That was certainly the expectation at Manchester Town Hall, where chief constables and police and crime commissioners (PCCs) had gathered for their annual joint conference. At 12:30, a large group of them took their places around a television set in a room set aside for exhibitors to watch the chancellor's statement. The mood was sombre. Most chiefs and PCCs had been planning for cuts of 20-25%. The Inspectorate of Constabulary had suggested that by 2018, forces would have to shed at least 12,000 officer, staff and police community support officer (PCSO) posts, with further reductions after that. The inspectorate, known for its careful, measured commentary, warned some forces might not be able to withstand another round of cuts, because they were not efficient enough. It said the \"operational viability\" of some could be \"in jeopardy\". The National Police Chiefs Council, which co-ordinates the work of forces, feared the job losses would be even worse - 35,000 by 2020, which, Sara Thornton, who chairs the council, said in July, would be a \"game changer\". Constabularies with large urban areas stood to lose the most, as they tend to rely more on Home Office funding, among them Northumbria, which gets 85% of its income from central government, and the West Midlands, 83%. So, when the announcement came, towards the end of Mr Osborne's statement, that there would be no further policing cuts, there was genuine disbelief, mixed with delight. Kevin Hurley, Surrey's PCC, described the atmosphere as \"euphoric\", as though England had won the World Cup. Essex Chief Constable Steve Kavanagh held his hand over his mouth in shock.\n",

But after passing stringent new safety tests, Kyushu Electric Power restarted the number one reactor at its Sendai plant on Tuesday morning. There is still strong public unease about a return to nuclear power. Protests have been taking place outside the Sendai plant and at Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's residence in Tokyo, about 1,000 km (600 miles) away. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo says that after being told a disaster like Fukushima could never happen, public confidence has been shaken. A total of 25 plants have applied to be restarted, he says, but all are facing legal challenges from concerned locals. What is happening inside the Sendai reactor? Kyushu said reactor No.1 at Sendai began operating again at 10:30 local time (01:30 GMT). TV images showed the plant's control room as workers turned the reactor back on. Kyushu Electric spokesman Tomomitsu Sakata said the reactor had gone back online without any problems. It will be about 24 hours before a full reaction takes place, and the plant is expected to start generating power by Friday. It will reach full capacity some time next month. Prime Minister Abe said on Monday that the reactors had passed \"the world's toughest safety screening\". \"I would like Kyushu Electric to put safety first and take utmost precautions for the restart,\" he said. Since shutting down all nuclear plants, Japan has been relying on imported fossil fuels for its energy, at huge expense. The government has said nuclear power must resume to cut both import bills and growing CO2 emissions. Experts have also warned that reactors left idle for years tend to experience teething problems and that such a mass restart of dormant reactors has never been attempted before, says our correspondent. Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority approved two reactors at the Sendai plant last September under stricter safety rules. The second reactor is due to be restarted in October. More than $100m (£64m) has been spent on fitting new safety systems at the Sendai plant. But local residents say the new safety regulations are not\n",

Ireland flanker Ferris drew attention to the incident during England's 30-9 Six Nations victory on 17 March, but it was not spotted by referee Nigel Owens. \"I am disappointed by the result,\" said Hartley, who may decide to appeal. \"I will wait for the written judgment as to how the panel came to their conclusion. \"I now have to put it behind me and focus on supporting Saints in training and off the field.\" Hartley has been ruled out of the rest of the regular domestic season but he could return if Saints reach the Premiership final on 26 May. The lowest suspension for biting is 12 weeks, with a maximum sanction of four years. But an independent Six Nations disciplinary committee decided Hartley's case was worthy of a lesser punishment after Tuesday's hearing. \"The offence merited a low entry point in the International Rugby Board's table of sanctions and allowed mitigation of four weeks,\" said a statement released by the committee. The panel listened to evidence from both Hartley and Ferris, who spoke via videolink, while England forwards coach Graham Rowntree and Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder also represented their player. Rowntree said: \"It is unfortunate for Dylan and Northampton, especially as he was in good form during the Six Nations, and he has developed as a player and a leader. \"However, we are looking forward to him being available for the tour to South Africa.\" Mallinder added: \"We are disappointed that Dylan has been suspended, especially at a crucial part of the season.\" It is the second time Hartley has received a lengthy suspension from the game.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage hit back by accusing Mr Clarke of holding millions of British people \"in utter contempt\". He said Mr Clarke was \"obviously not interested\" in winning back disaffected Tory voters at Thursday's local elections in England and Wales. It comes as UKIP accused the Tories of conducting a \"morally reprehensible\" smear campaign against its local election candidates. The anti-EU party has expanded rapidly, recruiting a record 1,732 candidates to contest Thursday's local elections. It admits it has not had the time or money to vet all of them properly. UKIP says it has evidence that smears about its candidates are being spread by Conservative Central Office, which it claims has been trawling would-be UKIP councillors' Twitter and Facebook pages for months. \"Were we inclined to return the favour, we would find even more examples to use against them. \"We deem that using our candidates as cannon fodder to undermine a political campaign (is) morally reprehensible and downright dirty,\" said a spokesman. The party is investigating six candidates over links to the BNP and other far right groups or alleged racist and homophobic comments, following stories in national and local newspapers. \"I am glad they have found some candidates in the BNP because we don't want them.

More than 150 people were jailed in connection with protests over the deal, though many were later acquitted or had their sentences reduced on appeal. The Egyptian government has said it will challenge Tuesday's ruling. Tiran and Sanafir are uninhabited and located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, a strategic part of the Red Sea bordered by Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Egyptian troops have been stationed there since 1950 at Riyadh's request. Mr Sisi's decision in April to cede control of them to Saudi Arabia sparked widespread criticism. The president was accused of violating the constitution and \"selling\" the islands in return for a multi-billion dollar aid package unveiled by King Salman during his visit. But Mr Sisi insisted that Tiran and Sanafir had always belonged to Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, Egypt's State Council, an administrative court, issued a verdict annulling April's maritime borders agreement between Cairo and Riyadh. The maritime border agreement signed earlier this year between Egypt and Saudi Arabia took many Egyptians by surprise. Since then, protesters have taken to the streets calling the arrangement unconstitutional, and accusing the government of giving away Egyptian territories in return for aid packages and investments worth billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia, a strong backer of President Sisi. Some of these protesters were arrested and charged with disrupting public order. A few are still behind bars. The lawsuit was filed by a number of prominent human rights lawyers, headed by a former presidential candidate, Khaled Ali. When the verdict was issued, many cheered inside the courtroom, chanting \"the islands are Egyptian\". But the legal battle has not come to an end yet, because the decision can be appealed. The verdict stated that the two islands would \"remain under Egyptian sovereignty\". If it is approved by the country's High Administrative Court it will become legally binding.

Sir Thomas said a \"smaller service\" would have to \"work smarter\". In December, the chief of the Met Police warned public safety would be at risk unless radical measures were taken to deal with funding cuts. But speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, newly knighted Sir Thomas said: \"Austerity is here to stay. \"The police have already made, and done it well in the main, cuts of 20% in the last four years and they are facing cuts of a further 5% next year. \"There will inevitably be a time where they can't take any more but let us remember that measured crime has fallen dramatically - but so have the demands made on the police.\" Asked if there was room for further cuts, Sir Thomas said: \"In some respects there are further efficiencies to be obtained, that is undoubtedly the case. \"They [police forces] need to work smarter because they will be working smaller.\" Sir Thomas said forces had not done enough work to analyse new demands being made on them, particularly with regards to cyber crime. He also said that while any crime reported to the police had to be taken seriously, there were some crimes that were \"more serious than others\". \"Nobody would argue that shoplifting is as serious as a violent assault and therefore the police need to look for the crimes that matter most to people, that do greatest harms to communities - serious and organised crime, drugs, violent offences, the grooming and sexual exploitation of children,\" he said. Last month, Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said that unless police \"act fast\" and with \"courage\" to implement far-reaching reforms, the cuts would endanger public safety.

That speech - one of the first to be shown on television live from the House of Commons - was the beginning of Thatcher's downfall as prime minister. It was all the more remarkable because no one thought Howe had it in him to be Thatcher's political assassin. Least of all Thatcher herself. Howe had been at her side as her chancellor, foreign secretary and deputy prime minister since the very beginning of her reign in Downing Street. But he was often viewed as an ineffectual yes-man, and was someone she increasingly treated with impatience and disdain, in front of cabinet colleagues. The play's title comes from one of the most widely-quoted political put-downs of all time, when Labour's Dennis Healey described being attacked by Howe as like being \"savaged by a dead sheep\". Howe's frustration at Thatcher's increasingly strident anti-EU stance at a time when he was trying to negotiate Britain's membership of the European Exchange Rate mechanism, and his demotion to the \"non-job\" of deputy prime minister, was the trigger for his resignation. His resignation speech, given two weeks after he quit the cabinet, stunned the Commons into silence, as he compared himself to a cricketer who had been sent out to the crease, only to discover his bat had been smashed by the team's captain. But in an era packed with larger-than-life Conservative politicians such as Michael Heseltine, Alan Clark and Thatcher herself, the famously uncharismatic Howe is still not the obvious choice to place centre stage. \"I just admire him so much because he really, really meant it. In all these films and plays I've seen he gets treated like a shifty-eyed buffoon and I was thinking 'No!,'\" playwright Jonathan Maitland told BBC News after the play's opening night. \"I've read his book umpteen times.

But Hollingsworth said: \"We are here to win medals, but within both the letter and the spirit of the Paralympics.\" Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, an 11-time Paralympic champion, has said the issue \"goes to the heart of the integrity of the sport\". The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) says the system is always under review, while UK Athletics said it will review classifications after Rio. The Paralympics start on 7 September and run until 18 September. The classification system puts athletes into groups depending on the level of their impairment to try to ensure fair competition. But British T37 200m sprinter Bethany Woodward told the Sunday Times she was withdrawing from the ParalympicsGB squad for Rio and had lost faith in the way the team was selected. Woodward, 23, who has cerebral palsy, said: \"I represented my country for a long time but if I can't compete like I used to compete, because they've brought in people who are not like me in terms of disability, what's the point?\" UK Athletics has said that Woodward was not in consideration for selection because she had not met the necessary criteria.

The most controversial were the 14 \"Class A\" war criminals, including wartime leader Hideki Tojo, who were \"enshrined\" in the late 1970s. These men were the ones who ordered and oversaw Japan's brutal war in China and South East Asia. Yasukuni Shrine It was a war in which millions died, in which there were widespread massacres of civilians, in which rape was routinely used as a weapon and where Japan used chemical and biological warfare against civilians. So if the shrine is so offensive to China and South Korea why did Mr Abe go? Firstly, because he wanted to. Close observers of the Japanese prime minister say he is at heart a nationalist and a historical revisionist. He believes the trials that convicted Japan's wartime leaders were \"victors' justice\". His own grandfather Nobusuke Kishi served in the war cabinet and was arrested by the Americans on suspicion of being a Class A war criminal. He was later released without charge. But the stain of association with Japan's war crimes in China never completely went away. Secondly, Mr Abe's support base comes from the right wing of the Liberal Democratic Party. According to Professor Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo, Mr Abe is \"showing he is a tough guy\", that he is not afraid of China. It is something that plays very well to his base. But there is perhaps a bigger goal that Mr Abe has in mind. He wants to radically revise Japan's post-war constitution. This, too, is a long-held dream that started with his grandfather in the 1950s. Mr Abe believes he is the man to complete the historic task of getting rid of the hated \"peace constitution\". Like many on the right here, Mr Abe believes that constitution was forced on Japan by America and is a humiliation. It imposes not only pacifism, but also Western notions of human rights and civil liberties. It rejects Japan's uniqueness in favour of \"universal values\". Mr Abe would like to change a lot of this.

The accuracy of seven wrist devices were tested while 60 volunteers were asked to walk, run and cycle. Researchers found that six out of seven of the fitness devices were good at estimating the heart rate of the person wearing it, with an error rate under 5%. They were the Apple Watch, Fitbit Surge, Basis Peak, Microsoft Band, PulseOn and MIP Alpha 2 - but the Samsung Gear S2 had the highest error rate of 6.8%. However, when it came to keeping track of energy used during exercise, the five devices that performed this function were all a long way out. Not one of the devices had an error rate below 20% - and some, such as the PulseOn, were much more inaccurate, the US research team found. Dr Euan Ashley, co-author of the study from the department of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford University, said the public should be aware of the strengths and limitations of fitness devices worn on the wrist. \"People need to know that on energy expenditure they give rough estimates. \"If you go to the gym, and you think you've lost 400 calories, then you might feel you've got 400 calories to play with,\" he said. That could be an issue if people were basing their diet on what they thought they had burnt off, he said. Technology for measuring heart rate had moved on quickly over the past five or six years, but on energy expenditure \"it's not quite there yet\", he added. It may be that companies are not using heart rates in their calculations. There is also a very wide difference in calories burnt between one person and another. For example, 10,000 steps could equate to anything from 400 kilocalories to 800 kilocalories lost, depending on a person's height and weight alone, the study said. Dr David Ellis, lecturer in computation social science at Lancaster University, said working out the number of calories burnt was a tricky business and relied on many different factors such as height, weight, percentage of body fat, heart rate and more. \"However, because manufactures do not share the algorithms [which are constantly updated] used to determine calories burned, it is almost impossible to know the exact\n",

The former resident of Marsh Farm Estate in Luton has pleaded not guilty to murder, rape and sexual assault. A man who saw Mr Maguire stabbed three times said the accused \"showed no regrets or remorse\" afterwards. Luton Crown Court heard the attacks happened at Mr Maguire's home in Thrales Close between 18:00 and 20:15. The prosecution allege Mr Nelson was in the middle of a spree of violence, having sexually assaulted a 25-year-old woman in the stairway of some flats and then a 60-year-old woman in her flat. Witness Dennis Kamau said he and his girlfriend were looking to buy some cannabis when he came across Mr Nelson near the Nisa store on the estate. He took the pair to Mr Maguire's home where the men entered the house while the woman stayed outside. After the pair agreed to share a deal, they went to the kitchen where Mr Maguire removed a tin from a kitchen cabinet. Mr Kamau said: \"The next thing I saw was a knife rise above and attack Jordan. \"I saw the knife go into Jordan. Jordan acted all shocked. He stabbed him a second time.\" Mr Kamau told the jury the victim was then stabbed in the back by Mr Nelson who said \"You little pussy\" before putting the knife away and riding off on his bike. \"I was scared, terrified and shocked,\" said Mr Kamau. Asked how the accused appeared, he said: \"He showed no regrets or remorse.\" A stab wound to the chest had punctured Mr Maguire's aorta and he was fatally injured. The jury earlier heard Mr Nelson stayed for two weeks with a girlfriend in Ipswich before flying to his native Grenada and was later arrested in Trinidad.\n",

The eggs were laid six weeks later than usual leading to concerns over whether the chicks would hatch. Parents Monty and Glesni set up home on a 30ft (9m) tall man-made nest on 3 May. They are one of only two known breeding pairs in Wales, with a second pair nesting near Croesor in the Glaslyn Valley. Staff and volunteers at the Cors Dyfi nature reserve had an anxious wait for the chicks who took 32 hours to emerge from their shells. Cracks in the first egg were spotted on Friday afternoon, with the bird finally hatching at about 21:00 BST. The second chick started chipping away from inside its egg on Saturday afternoon but did not hatch until 20:40 BST on Sunday. Monty and Glesni became a breeding pair for the first time this year after Monty's previous partner of two years, Nora, did not return from her African migration. Ospreys return from migration in late March or April and usually lay eggs two or three weeks later. But Monty and Glesni did not pair until 3 May and their two eggs were laid between 22 and 25 May - six weeks later than average. Alwyn Evans, of Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, said: \"By the time Monty finally paired off with his new partner, Glesni, a three-year-old bird from Rutland Water, it was getting late in the season. \"At that stage none of us knew if they would lay eggs, let alone whether they would hatch. \"It's been an emotional weekend to say the least.\" Mr Evans said cracks in the second egg on Saturday were greeted with loud applause and shouting from visitors at the wildlife trust's osprey centre who had gathered to watch the birds hatch. Last month the wildlife trust said ospreys were still persecuted and egg collecting remained a problem in the UK.

Simmonds landed his fourth kick to convert a second-half penalty try. A Sam Skinner score and a second Short effort ensured the bonus-point victory. The win lifts them to within a point of leaders Wasps, who face Gloucester on Sunday. For 20-year-old fly-half Simmonds, it was the perfect day with the boot as he replaced injured veteran Gareth Steenson in a side that was missing a number of players - including England's Jack Nowell and Henry Slade - due to Six Nations duties. Newcastle, who a week earlier earned an impressive 46-31 win over Northampton at Kingston Park, made a strong start with Goneva crossing for a superb try, which started with a bustling run from Calum Green. Short, who would finish the day by touching down for the fifth time in two games, restored parity for the first time with a 90-metre effort, which came from an error as Newcastle closed in on a second try. While Exeter were made to work hard for their first-half lead after Vickers again edged Falcons ahead, the hosts were more ruthless after the break and heavily restricted Newcastle, who are still without a win at Sandy Park. Exeter Chiefs assistant coach Ali Hepher: \"Newcastle are a good side and in good form and came here with a good deal of confidence but we started poorly, especially in defence. \"We were hesitant in that first half particularly when we had ball in hand as we needed to run hard instead of trying the clever ball. \"There was plenty to address at half-time but our defence was outstanding in that second half and to earn a bonus point was invaluable. \"Moving one point into second and above Saracens at this stage is not important as the top four places are really tight but we are hoping to remain there and to secure a top two finish would be really nice.\" Newcastle Falcons director of rugby Dean Richards: \"I'm disappointed as we started really well but we weren't accurate enough and this allowed them back into the game. \"We should have been further\n",

In the context of horse racing, and sport in general, it is a triumph of commitment and perseverance which may never be rivalled. Johnson has been trying to win it since the 1990s. It is his curse, and his blessing, that his career coincided with Sir Anthony (AP) McCoy. For 20 years in succession McCoy was champion. Throughout that time, almost every year, the man who finished behind him in second place was Richard Johnson. I met up with Richard Johnson in Somerset at the yard of trainer Philip Hobbs - their relationship has been an important part of the jockey's career. At 7.30 on an April morning Johnson was helping to school a group of the yard's horses, taking them over hurdles and fences on a field high above the Bristol Channel. In racing this might be termed 'work' but for Johnson, even at 38 years of age, he insists it is still pleasure. \"This is all I've ever wanted to do so it's not a job. Unfortunately I'm going to have to get a job one day when I have to stop doing it, but genuinely you love doing it. I think the 'job' is the driving round, the long days, but riding the horses is the fun bit,\" he said. Media playback is not supported on this device \"But for me being champion jockey was the thing I've always wanted to do since I was a child growing up. So I suppose actually to reach that goal is always what I wanted to do and there's a lot of satisfaction. \"When AP McCoy retired at the end of last year I sort of thought, well I should be able to have a good chance at it. But there was a pressure. If I don't become champion jockey now maybe I'll not achieve what I wanted to. But the season's been absolutely amazing. My agent Dave Roberts works tirelessly to keep me busy and sends me round the country on a daily basis to hopefully achieve what I have.\" Roberts was McCoy's agent too and in simple terms Johnson has picked up rides this year which may have previously gone to McCoy.

When her college friends realised that she had never tasted a macaron - a small, colourful circular cake made from ground almonds and filled with cream or icing - they whisked her to one of the best macaron shops in the French capital. After just one bite, Ms Dhingra decided there and then that when she returned to Mumbai she would open her own macaron store, the first of its kind in India. \"This might sound dramatic, but I realised that yes, this is what I want to do, I want to go back to India and take macarons with me. This was my mission,\" she says. Fast forward seven years, and Ms Dhingra, now 28, is the owner of three busy macaron shops in Mumbai. Another three stores will open in the city this year, and she has plans to expand her business, Le 15 Patisserie, across the country. Yet as a young businesswoman in India, she says it hasn't always been plain sailing. Ms Dhingra should have been a lawyer. But while studying law at university in Mumbai, she decided that she wanted to quit to do something more creative. Remembering helping her mother in the kitchen during her childhood, she decided to work with food instead of legal cases. So she convinced her parents to let her go to Switzerland to study hospitality and management. After three years at a Swiss catering college, Ms Dhingra did one year at the well-known Le Cordon Bleu school in Paris. Returning to Mumbai upon graduation, she set to work in her parents' kitchen on developing her own macaron recipe. Yet with the weather in Mumbai being substantially hotter and more humid than Paris, she struggled for half a year, as the heat and humidity makes it difficult to make the delicate cakes. \"When I started making macarons, first at my home kitchen, it was a complete disaster,\" she says. \"It took me around six months of research and 60 failed recipes to finally get something right.\" When she finally had a recipe she was proud of, her businessman father agreed to invest the initial funds she required to set up the business.

Eurostat data also showed the jobless rate fell to 9.6% in December, the lowest rate since May 2009. GDP growth edged up to 0.5% in the final three months of 2016, up from 0.4% in the previous quarter. The rise in eurozone inflation last month was driven by an 8.1% jump in energy prices in January compared with the year before. The spike in the rate takes it up to the European Central Bank's inflation target of close to, but below, 2%. Some have called for the European Central Bank to further scale back its bond-buying programme. However, the ECB also looks at core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food prices, in its policy decisions, and this rate remained unchanged at 0.9% in January. In December, the ECB said it would buy bonds worth 60bn euros a month from April. The 80bn euro-a-month quantitative easing scheme had been due to end in March, but was expected to be extended. The stimulus programme was an effort to increase the supply of money in the economic bloc to keep interest rates low, and encourage borrowing and spending. The European Central Bank's key job is to maintain \"price stability\" in the Eurozone, which it interprets as inflation of below but close to 2%. For the last few years it has been wrestling with inflation that its governing council considers too low, at times even below zero - a situation of deflation or falling prices. That has led the bank to choose very unusual policies intended to stimulate prices rises - ultra-low interest rates (one of its rates is negative) and quantitative easing, buying financial assets with newly created money. So with inflation now at 1.8%, pretty much in line with the target, is that job done? Time to turn the policy taps off? Not necessarily. The rise in inflation is down to higher food and especially energy prices. The impact of those factors is likely to fade and other price rises are still relatively slow. There are different views in the ECB's governing council but the majority are not likely to be in a hurry to get policy back to normal.

Mr Lloyd, who has electromagnetic hypersensitivity, said he was entitled to direct payments to employ a helper. The council, which was ordered to pay £12,000 in costs, had claimed he was not capable of managing money. Quashing the council's decision on Wednesday, Mr Justice Singh said electromagnetic hypersensitivity was not a recognised condition in the UK. He added it was \"not a matter for the court to say what the decision would have been if the authority went about its decision correctly\". Direct payments are given to individuals by councils so they can buy help or services instead of having them supplied by the authority. Mr Lloyd lives in the back garden of a privately-owned home in Thornhill and has refused alternative accommodation and a portable toilet, the court heard. He urinates in plastic bottles and defecates in bed pans lined with black bin bags. He has no running water and an insurance company deemed the house uninhabitable after flooding and the discovery of asbestos - although that has since been removed. When council workers went to collect Mr Lloyd's waste in May, they found 90 litres of urine and 40 bags of faeces.

            "Input: summarize: GCSE results are being changed to grades 9 to 1, with the first such grades to be published this week. But there will be two different pass marks - grade 4 as a \"standard\" pass and grade 5 as a \"strong\" pass. Researchers say pupils need to be at grade 5 to match global rivals. The study from the Education Policy Institute says England's school system faces an \"immense challenge\" if it is going to match the levels of achievement in countries such as Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan. GCSEs in England are being made more challenging and will be decided by final exams rather than coursework, with the first results of these new-style GCSEs being published for English and maths this week. These will be graded from 9 to 1, with a grade 4 being counted as a \"standard\" pass, similar to a grade C. But the researchers say that on average pupils should be achieving a \"strong\" pass at grade 5, if England is going to keep up with international competitors. At present, the researchers say, only 40% of pupils in state schools have reached this \"world-class standard\". To keep up in maths, the study says, it would require an increase of over a third of pupils getting top grades and an average above grade 5. \"The old C grade is not an adequate national aspiration if England wants to compete with top education nations,\" says David Laws, former Education Minister and executive chairman of the Education Policy Institute. \"This analysis highlights the gulf between education outcomes in England and the performance of the world's best education nations,\" he said. \"In certain subjects, such as maths, England needs both to significantly raise the number of top performers and almost halve the number of low performers if it is to compete with the world's best.\" Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers said: \"This report shows that England's obsession with structural change, under a succession of governments, has had little impact on either standards or equity. \"Policy makers have routinely pursued the wrong priorities,\" said Mr Whiteman. \"The highest performing school systems are those that invest in their teachers and that respect and value education.\" Kevin Courtney, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said that even if the overall results at national level were kept in line with previous years, individual schools\n",

            "Input: summarize: The Shadow Man, and a Christmas poem called Noel, were found at Our Lady's School, Abingdon. It is thought Tolkien got to know the school while he was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University. The poems were printed a year before Tolkien's first literary sensation The Hobbit was published. The Shadow Man is an earlier version of a poem eventually published in 1962 in Tolkien's Adventures of Tom Bombadil collection. The existence of the poems came to light after American Tolkien scholar Wayne G. Hammond got in touch with the school. He knew from notes made by Tolkien that two of his poems appeared in a magazine he called The Abingdon Chronicle. This was actually the 1936 annual of Our Lady's School, which was then run by the Sisters of Mercy. School principal Stephen Oliver said: \"At first we couldn't find the 1936 edition and referred Mr Hammond to the archives of the Sisters of Mercy in London. \"Then, while preparing for an event for former pupils of the school, we uncovered our own copy and I saw the two poems Mr Hammond had been looking for. \" The school hopes to put the annual on display at a future exhibition.\n",

Mr Rouhani won Friday's presidential election in the first round. He promised voters a moderate and outward-looking Iran and criticised the conservative-dominated judiciary. Council elections were held alongside the presidential vote and the results were announced on Sunday. The new city council must convene within 45 days when it will elect a new mayor to oversee services for Tehran's nine million residents. Incumbent Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf was a candidate in the early stages of the presidential election but dropped out to back hardliner Ebrahim Raisi. Mr Raisi only received 38.5% of the vote, which was not enough to take the election to a second round. President Rouhani, 68, said his resounding victory showed that voters rejected extremism and wanted more links with the outside world. Analysts say he is in a strong position to seek reforms and to revive Iran's ailing economy. After his re-election there were celebrations in the capital, Tehran, with crowds of young people singing and dancing in the central Vali Asr Square. In his first speech after the result was announced Mr Rouhani said: \"The Iranian nation has chosen the path of interaction with the world, a path which is distant from extremism and violence.\" Mr Rouhani supports the landmark deal with world powers to curb Iran's nuclear programme.\n",

It is believed to be the first time in England and Wales such an order has been made. Shira - who did not want to disclose her full name - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the abuse started shortly after they met in 2011. \"The first incident was a few months after we met and it started over the phone.

However 59% of voters opposed the plan in Sunday's referendum vote. The government will now need to find an alternative, which may involve higher tax rates for multinational companies. \"It will not be possible to find a solution overnight,\" said Ueli Maurer, Switzerland's finance minister. He told a press conference it could take a year to come up with a new plan, and that Switzerland risked losing foreign investment as a result. Currently Switzerland grants special status to foreign firms which allows cantons, or districts, to offer them lower rates of tax than domestic firms, making Switzerland an attractive destination for foreign investors. But international organisations such as the OECD have deemed the system unacceptable and Switzerland has made a commitment to reform it by 2019. To avoid raising taxes for multinational companies too sharply the government had agreed to abolish the special status for multinationals but instead offer new tax breaks for research and development and other activities. As part of the proposal, Switzerland's cantons planned to lower their tax rates for businesses across the board, including domestic business, helping to avoid steep rises in tax bills when foreign firms' status was brought into line. Some of the resulting budget shortfall in the cantons would have been plugged by federal funds. But the plan was opposed by Social Democrats, Greens, trade unions and churches who argued that the reduced tax revenue would still lead to cuts in public services or higher personal taxes. \"The conservative parties wanted to push through tax reform with arrogance and haughtiness against the interests of the people. The Greens demand a new proposal with a sense of proportion,\" the opposition leftist party said of the vote.\n",

            "Input: summarize: How much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why. It used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier. This is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows. Then we had the financial crisis of 2008. The upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them. For example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of £27,000 at the age of 28, compared with £28,000 for those born in the 1970s. The figure was £21,000 for those born in the 1960s and £15,000 for those born in the 1950s. Despite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age. By their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about £27,000 each, on average. By the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - £53,000 each. A large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither. At the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s. Home ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30. Similarly, the Local Government Association reported in December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago. The lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices. In their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs. At the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by\n",

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has placed a temporary export bar on the watercolour in the hope a UK buyer can match the asking price of £1m. \"We have very few paintings of the palace so I really hope we can find a buyer to keep this masterpiece here in Britain,\" he said. The piece is the oldest of six remaining depictions of the palace, considered to be one of the Renaissance period's most stunning buildings. Nonsuch Palace - named because no other palace could equal it - was built in 1538 for the Tudor king to celebrate the birth of his first legitimate son and mark his 30th year on the throne, It was intended to rival the opulent residences of French king Francis I. In 1670 Charles II gave the palace to his mistress, Barbara Villiers, who began to dismantle and sell parts of the building to pay off gambling debts. By 1690 the building had all but disappeared. The painting went for auction in 2010 but failed to meet its reserve price of £1.2m. The decision to defer the export licence follows a recommendation by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA), administered by Arts Council England. They made their recommendation on the grounds of its close association with our history and national life, its outstanding aesthetic importance and its outstanding significance for understanding the nature of English Renaissance architecture. The decision on the export licence application for the watercolour will be deferred until 31 May.\n",

Although he has been a supporter since he was 10, he doesn't usually put his money where his heart is. But, mulling over their prospects on a camping holiday he found he was encouraged by the team's performance at the end of last season, and, taking a shine to the appointment of Claudio Ranieri as manager, he decided to put down the £5 bet for his team to win. \"I thought, they're going to do something special this season,\" he says. \"I really enjoyed the first half of the season, the second half just got harder and harder. \"I would feel sick watching them play.\" Eventually, he cashed out £2 of his £5 bet, making £5,600, but left the £3 remainder in place, which eventually won him £15,000.

Film-maker Grigorij Richters, 26, from Hamburg, Germany, met Stephen at the Champions League final at Wembley in May 2013 and they became friends. The visit to Wembley was on the \"bucket list\" of 46 ambitions Stephen wanted to achieve before he died, along with raising money for the Teenage Cancer Trust. The pair agreed to film the bucket list together and he now has hours of footage, which he wants to use to tell Stephen's story. Mr Richters said Stephen was \"a young man who did the inconceivable, the unbelievable, at a young age\".

Bay County Sheriff's Office told the BBC the female victim had turned up with a male friend, whom she had just met in a bar, at the accused's home at around 01:00 local time on Monday. Ms Savell told police her hospitality began to wear thin after her guests began drinking and raising their voices. But instead of dropping a hint by yawning or loading the dishwasher, she armed herself with a 22-calibre handgun and shot at her guests' feet, officials said. As well as shooting the woman, Kristy Jo Mohr, in both legs in the incident, and her companion, who went by name \"Cowboy\", Ms Savell's own boyfriend was struck by a bullet in the leg. Ms Mohr told police she believed eight or nine shots were fired in total.

He is likely to face challenges on ballot deadlines and fundraising just three months before Election Day. The 40-year-old Mormon has never held elected office. Mr McMullin, an outspoken critic of the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, released a statement to ABC News. \"It's never too late to do the right thing, and America deserves much better than either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton can offer us. I humbly offer myself as a leader who can give millions of disaffected Americans a conservative choice for President,\" Mr McMullin said.

Wycombe defender Joe Jacobson's free-kick on 13 minutes drew a decent save from James McKeown. Garry Thompson had another good chance for the hosts on 50 minutes, but wastefully blazed his half-volley wide from 25 yards. Wycombe led five minutes later, though. Luke Summerfield brought down Jacobson on the edge of the box, and Jombati stepped up to place the ball beyond McKeown for the home side's first goal in 112 days. Cameron Dawson was forced into a sharp double save after 69 minutes, diving to his right to stop Summerfield's fierce shot, then saving Kayden Jackson's follow-up with his legs. Ten minutes later, though, Grimsby deservedly equalised when Boyce passed the ball beyond Dawson after Wycombe failed to clear a corner.

Her three-day old daughter, Isabella, was removed from her for five days in April 2010. The lawsuit argued that the opiate test in question had a far lower threshold than federal guidelines. Jameson Hospital failed to inform Ms Mort that she had failed the test, then reported it to Lawrence County children and youth services without a secondary test. \"Elizabeth Mort never imagined that the last thing she ate before giving birth to her daughter - a poppy seed bagel - would lead to the loss of her newborn, but that is exactly what happened after the Jameson Health System failed to account for the possibility that her positive urine drug screen was due to her ingestion of poppy seeds,\" the lawsuit said. Child welfare officials arrived the day after the family returned from hospital with an emergency protective custody order and took Isabella. She was later returned after the agency could find no evidence Ms Mort had used illegal drugs. The lawsuit, which was filed on her behalf by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), was settled on Tuesday. ACLU officials said Jameson had changed its policy to ensure newborns were not taken from parents solely on the basis of maternal drug test results. \"We hope that this case will encourage hospitals that routinely test pregnant women for drug use to reconsider that practice due to the harm that can result from false positives,\" said ACLU lawyer Sara Rose.\n",

The 29-year-old will return to action on Wednesday, 26 April, in Stuttgart after being handed a wildcard. Although some fellow players have expressed misgivings, she has the support of the WTA tour, and her fans. And, with biggest commercial rival Serena Williams announcing she is pregnant and facing time away from the game, the Russian's return is certainly timely. In the year from June 2015, Forbes estimates the five-time Grand Slam winner made $1.9m (£1.5m) in prize money from playing, but a whopping $20m from endorsements, a sum matched only by Williams. And it is this primary source of earnings that Sharapova will be looking to reinvigorate. \"During her time out there will have been some continued relationship with her sponsors,\" says Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford. \"But I am sure there will have been some sort of penalty clause in her sponsor contracts for incurring a suspension.\" Following Sharapova's admission in March 2016 that she had tested positive for a banned drug at that year's Australian Open, she was initially banned by the International Tennis Federation for two years, later reduced on appeal. But unlike golfer Tiger Woods, who haemorrhaged sponsors very quickly after his extra-marital affairs came to light, Sharapova's backers waited to see how things played out. \"That was because they had invested so much money and effort into their deals,\" says Prof Chadwick. \"Also, to terminate deals could have been dangerous as she might come back successfully, and if you as a sponsor have decided to cancel her contract then the door has been left wide open for a rival.\" As it was the sponsor reaction was mixed - Head and Evian were immediately supportive, Nike and Porsche put their relationships on hold but later came back on board, while Tag Heuer and Avon chose not to extend deals that had ended.

There are limits on warheads and on launchers, which must be implemented within seven years of the treaty's entry into force. Warheads: Under the New Start treaty each side is allowed a maximum of 1,550 warheads. This is about 30% lower than the figure of 2,200 that each side was meant to reach by 2012 under the Start treaty (as revised in the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty). Launchers: Each country is allowed, in total, no more than 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear arms. Another 100 are allowed if they are not operationally deployed - for example, missiles removed from a sub undergoing a long-term overhaul. The new limit on delivery systems is less than half the ceiling of 1,600 specified in the original Start treaty. Not as dramatic as they might appear. The rules for counting warheads contain a big loophole. While each warhead on a ballistic missile is counted as one warhead, a heavy bomber is counted as carrying \"one warhead\" even though it may carry (in the case of a US B-52) up to 20 of them. According to the Arms Control Association, a pro-disarmament pressure group, the US could theoretically meet the new limits by cutting just 100 warheads, while Russia would only need to cut 190. In addition, the agreed ceilings refer to deployed warheads, not to warheads in storage. A warhead could, in theory, be put into storage, and then redeployed when needed. The cuts in launchers are also, in practice, not all that challenging. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists estimates that Russia currently has 566 - well under the permitted ceiling of 700. It estimates that the US has 798, necessitating a cut of about 12%. Supporters of the deal say that while it does not make big cuts, it is a useful confidence-building measure, which could pave the way for further nuclear deals with Russia. They say it also signals to the rest of the world that the US and Russia are not ignoring\n",

Third, I call on them to resume a peaceful and orderly political transition and to ensure that the process includes more representation from other political parties, women, youth and civil society.\" The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva said the Houthi representatives were apparently delayed over what airspace their plane could fly through. She said that the confusion did not bode well for the talks. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states has been bombing the Houthi rebels and their allies since March. The bombing campaign was launched to support Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who escaped to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, when the Houthis advanced on his stronghold in Aden in southern Yemen. In recent weeks, fighting between Saudi forces and the Houthis has intensified on Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia. On Saturday, Saudi Arabia claimed to have shot down a Scud missile fired by the Houthis. The attack followed fighting on the border on Friday, in which four Saudi soldiers and a number of Yemeni rebels died. On the same day, bombs hit the Old City of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, killing five people according to local sources.\n",

The figure contrasted with a stronger-than-expected start for the manufacturing sector published on Monday. Factory output rose from 52.1 in December to 52.9 in January. Any figure above 50 indicates growth in the sector. Markit economist Tim Moore said construction firms were struggling for momentum, with increased economic uncertainty holding back new orders and contributing to one of the weakest rises in output levels since summer 2013. \"Taken together with the slowdown in new order growth, the latest survey suggests that construction companies are braced for a relatively subdued first quarter,\" he said. David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which compiles the survey along with Markit, said a shortage of bricks and blocks contributed to the slowdown. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said weakness in construction orders and a downturn in public sector infrastructure work, which accounts for about a quarter of total construction and is not covered by the PMI, suggested the sector would post only \"lacklustre growth\" this year. Optimism among construction companies waned to its lowest level since December 2014, the survey showed. \"Some firms highlighted concerns that underlying demand conditions had started to soften,\" Markit said. Analysts use the PMI surveys for early signals about the economy. However, the construction sector figures have been at odds with data used in official growth figures in recent months. Growth in the dominant UK service sector fell slightly in December to 55.5 in December, down from 59.9 in November, but remained above average.\n",

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said that the policy is undermined by \"flawed and inaccurate data\". Education Minister John O'Dowd said he would consider what additional action, if any, needed to be taken. He said: \"The sustainable schools policy has been tested in court on several occasions and found to be a competent policy upon which to make decisions both about the future of individual schools and area planning more widely. \"I have already accepted the eight recommendations within the Northern Ireland Audit Office report and these are being progressed by my department.\" The policy is also used to plan educational provision across Northern Ireland. The PAC also said that the number of empty places in schools in Northern Ireland is \"likely to be overstated\". A Northern Ireland Audit Office (NIAO) report previously found the number of empty places totalled over 71,000, about 20% of capacity. However, the NIAO also said that the department did not have a standard method for calculating school capacity. The PAC said it was \"unacceptable\" that the department could not provide accurate numbers of surplus places. The committee is calling for up-to-date school enrolment figures to be gathered \"as a matter of urgency\". The PAC report also said the department took too long to take decisions on whether to close schools, and whether suspended teachers should be dismissed. It found that 106 teachers had been suspended during the past five years, but only six had been dismissed. The department paid £4.2m on wages, national insurance and pension contributions for suspended teachers during that period.

But she only realised she had taken the unusual picture when she went through the photos later, she told the Sydney Morning Herald. Animal experts say that witnessing such a partnership is rare. New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife whale expert Geoff Ross told the paper the coupling was very rare but he had heard of it happening once before. \"The only other time was a seal trying to get away from a killer whale. The seal hopped on the back of the pectoral fins of a humpback whale,\" he said. Ms Malcolm insisted that the photo was not doctored. \"I'm positive, because I don't know how to use Photoshop.

The meeting of seal and whale is the latest in a series of serendipitous animal piggyback rides which have been captured this year. In March, amateur photographer Martin Le-May shot this picture of a weasel clinging on to the back of a woodpecker at Hornchurch Country Park in east London. In June, a family walking in a forest in central Florida spotted this raccoon hitching a ride on the back of an alligator.

It comes as the number of traditional pubs have declined, with a pub closing every couple of days in Wales. But the number of breweries has doubled in the past five years to 88. \"It's growing really rapidly,\" said Buster Grant, chairman of Drinks Wales, which represents independent brewers as well as cider and wine producers. Welsh brewers are set to showcase their beers at two key events. There is Cardiff Brew Fest this weekend and a three-day festival in London next month will feature 100 Welsh beers and ciders. Mr Grant, managing director of Brecon Brewery, said: \"There's a growth of craft beer in places like Cardiff where people like stronger, hoppier beers and more extreme flavours but also there's still growth in more traditional ales. \"In an age of austerity, people are not going out quite as much but when they do they're seeking out something different; they're a little bit more picky about where they go and are prepared to pay a little bit more.\" He said Welsh brewers are taking their beers across the UK and looking abroad. At home, 20 small Welsh breweries now have their own pubs. Four micro breweries - Bragdy Nant, Bragdy Conwy, Purple Moose and Great Orme - got together to reopen one pub in Conwy three years ago and recently bought two more.

            "Input: summarize: Their study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, argued elderly people had the least to gain. The team at University College London (UCL) has called on doctors to discuss the risks more clearly with patients. The charity Diabetes UK said doctors needed to strike a careful balance when prescribing treatment. Type-2 diabetes is an inability to control blood sugar levels and is linked to lifestyle factors including diet and obesity. In the long-term it is linked to heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage and even blindness. Drugs such as metformin can be used to lower blood sugar levels to prevent the side effects. The report, which was carried out by the University of Michigan as well as UCL, said an average 45-year-old who dropped their blood sugar levels by one percentage point would gain 10 months of healthy life, compared with three weeks for a 75-year-old starting treatment. It added this needed to be balanced against the down-sides to a lifetime of medication including: Having to have multiple injections and blood sugar tests each day, drugs causing indigestion or sickness, or insulin treatments risking blood sugar levels dropping dangerously low (hypoglycaemia). One of the report's authors, Prof John Yudkin, told the BBC: \"What it means is if you're someone with type-2, it's your right to know what the benefits of the treatment are in terms of gain in life expectancy or reduction in heart attacks or going blind. \"And then you are entitled to decide, but not many doctors have got those figures to hand.\" He said GPs were too \"target focussed\" and were often looking only at the blood sugar level. The findings do not apply to people with type-1 diabetes. Commenting on the report, Simon O'Neill, the director for health intelligence at Diabetes UK, said: \"Sometimes there is a balance to be struck where certain medications might help give someone a longer life, but also cause side effects that might negatively impact on quality of life. \"This study highlights the importance of looking at the individual needs of the person with type-2 diabetes, rather than adopting a blanket approach.\" Patients are advised not to make any decisions without consulting their GP.

Mr Belhaj says he was then tortured as he had opposed the Gaddafi regime. Last December, the High Court found the claims were beyond its jurisdiction. At last year's hearing, the judge, Mr Justice Simon, said Abdul-Hakim Belhaj had a \"well-founded claim\" but pursuing it would jeopardise national security. Lawyers for Mr Belhaj have now taken the case to the Court of Appeal, where Richard Hermer QC said Mr Belhaj and his wife believed \"the UK played a key role in their mistreatment and wish to pursue a remedy against the UK and its officials for that\". Mr Belhaj, one of the leaders of the uprising against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, says he was abducted - along with his pregnant wife, Fatima Boudchar - in China in 2004 as he was about to fly to London to claim asylum. He alleged the UK had tipped off Libyan intelligence services and helped the US arrange his rendition. After he was returned to Libya, Mr Belhaj spent six years in jail, while his wife was released shortly before giving birth. The couple had been attempting to bring a case against former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and former senior MI6 official Sir Mark Allen. The High Court ruled that because most of the claims related to officials in China, Malaysia, Thailand and Libya the allegations were \"non-justiciable\" in the UK. Analysis By Dominic Casciani This case matters for one simple reason: it involves allegations that the UK colluded in handing over a man to a regime that tortured him.

Since Thursday, though, the Kurdish forces - backed by US air strikes - have made important ground, cutting early on the Highway 47 which passes Sinjar, the main supply line between IS' self-styled capital of Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in northern Iraq. Capturing Sinjar will not only secure the highway, but the road south of Sinjar, towards the IS-held town of Baaj, is also reported to be under control of the Peshmerga forces. This is supposed to provide a buffer zone large enough to keep Sinjar safe in the near future. However, it is by no means preventing IS from using scores of small countryside roads south of Sinjar that are still available until the winter weather makes them unusable. The next step has to be against the IS-held town of Tal Afar, and then Mosul. If not, Sinjar will always face attacks from those points. Yet, if Sinjar is de facto Kurdish territory, Tal Afar and Mosul are not. Profile: Who are the Peshmerga? Who are the Yazidis? Tal Afar is populated with Arabs and Turkmen: this means that the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) will not have any strategic interest in liberating and holding an area to which it has no claim. The same goes for Mosul and Baaj. While KRG President Massoud Barzani has repeatedly hinted that his government would contribute to the retaking of Mosul, recapturing an Arab city could be perceived as an act of Kurdish aggression against Arabs, raising tensions with the Baghdad government and potentially harming the Kurdish minority that has continued to live in Mosul since IS took it. Tactically, the town of Baaj, situated on higher grounds than Sinjar, will remain a perfect spot to target Sinjar. Since the Peshmerga do not possess long-range missiles, how will they be able to create a strong enough buffer zone for the 3,000 Yazidis trapped on the mountain for more than a year to be able\n",

Bergdahl was serving with an Alaska-based infantry regiment in Paktika province near the Pakistani border and went missing on 30 June 2009, five months after being deployed to Afghanistan. The circumstances of his capture remain murky, with speculation he may have walked away from his base out of disillusionment with the US campaign. In March 2015, he was charged with desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy. The US believes he was across the frontier in Pakistan for most of his captivity, reportedly held by the Haqqani network, which operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and is allied to the Afghan Taliban. Profile: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl The circumstances of Sgt Bergdahl's capture in 2009 remain unclear, although a Pentagon investigation a year later concluded he left his post in Paktika Province without authorisation, according to a Pentagon official speaking to Associated Press news agency. Several commentators and soldiers have branded him a deserter and called for him to be punished. The New York Times said on his disappearance in 2009 had noted he had left military areas before, during a training programme in California and an Afghan outpost, but returned each time. US officials told the newspaper the report did not conclude whether Sgt Bergdahl had intended to permanently desert the military. The US military's top-ranking officer, Gen Martin Dempsey, has that the Army would not ignore misconduct but that the 28-year-old was innocent until proven guilty. \"When he is able to provide the facts, we'll learn what happened.\" The defence department opened up an investigation into his disappearance and capture, appointing a two-star general with combat experience in Afghanistan to lead the inquiry. Taliban officials say the 28-year-old was handed over near Khost, close to the the Afghan-Pakistan border, on the evening of 31 May.

The 8.3 billion tonnes is as heavy as 25,000 Empire State Buildings in New York, or a billion elephants. The great issue is that plastic items, like packaging, tend to be used for very short periods before being discarded. More than 70% of the total production is now in waste streams, sent largely to landfill - although too much of it just litters the wider environment, including the oceans. \"We are rapidly heading towards 'Planet Plastic', and if we don't want to live on that kind of world then we may have to rethink how we use some materials, in particular plastic,\" Dr Roland Geyer told BBC News. A paper authored by the industrial ecologist from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and colleagues appears in the journal Science Advances. It is described as the first truly global assessment of how much plastic has been manufactured, how the material in all its forms is used, and where it ends up. Here are some of its key numbers. There is no question that plastics are a wonder material. Their adaptability and durability have seen their production and use accelerate past most other manmade materials apart from steel, cement and brick. From the start of mass-manufacturing in the 1950s, the polymers are now all around us - incorporated into everything from food wrapping and clothing, to aeroplane parts and flame retardants. But it is precisely plastics' amazing qualities that now present a burgeoning problem. None of the commonly used plastics are biodegradable. The only way to permanently dispose of their waste is to destructively heat it - through a decomposition process known as pyrolysis or through simple incineration; although the latter is complicated by health and emissions concerns. In the meantime, the waste mounts up. There is enough plastic debris out there right now, Geyer and colleagues say, to cover an entire country the size of Argentina. The team's hope is that their new analysis will give added impetus to the conversation about how best to deal with the plastics issue. \"Our mantra is you can't manage what you don't measure,\" Dr Geyer said. \"So, our idea was to put the numbers out there without us telling the world what the world should be\n",

Mr Justice Mostyn, who said he played Bridge on social occasions, heard a claim the game ought to be recognised as a \"mind sport\" that exercises the \"brain muscle\". Kate Gallofent QC, for Sport England, said the definition of a qualifying sport was an \"activity aimed at improving physical fitness and well being, forming social relations and gaining results in competition\". That definition is based on a European Sports Charter promoting \"a common European definition of sport\".

From beating ourselves up for not building anything, we are suddenly building everything. Heathrow was chosen because of the extra boost it gives to the UK economy, but it is not the only mammoth project out there. After a last minute wobble, the £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power station has been given the green light, while the biggest of them all is coming down the track fast. Construction on the £42bn HS2 high-speed rail line from London to the North is scheduled to begin next year. And that is probably not all. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has hinted he may reveal some moderate government borrowing to fund targeted infrastructure spending in his Autumn Statement next month. It is enough to make the Victorians sit up and take notice. If projections for a fairly sharp post-Brexit slowdown in the economy next year are correct, we may need this spending boost. Yet if these projects proceed on time, there is something else we will need: people to build it all. With unemployment close to historic lows, it is not clear we have enough. As the Victorians did, it seems very likely we will need to look abroad to find the workers for what some say promises to be a golden age of infrastructure. And that, post-Brexit, will present a political rather than an engineering challenge.\n",

            "Input: summarize: The poll has been triggered by the resignation of Tory MP Zac Goldsmith in protest at the government's backing for a third runway at Heathrow. Mr Goldsmith, who will run again as an independent, has said it \"must be a referendum on Heathrow expansion\". But the likely Lib Dem candidate said Mr Goldsmith's backing for Brexit would be \"uppermost in voters' minds\". Sarah Olney, who has already been selected to fight the seat at the next General Election, said it was a \"farce\" the by-election was taking place, saying it was the result of Tory in-fighting but added that the Lib Dems were looking forward to \"putting our message in front of voters\". Ms Olney, who like Mr Goldsmith is opposed to Heathrow expansion, told the BBC's Daily Politics: \"We are on the same side as far as Heathrow is concerned, so for the voters to be able to choose between us, it's going to be fought on other issues - and I think Brexit is currently going to be the main issue that's uppermost in voters' minds.\" A local breakdown of the EU referendum results shows almost 70% of voters in the Richmond council area, which makes up the bulk of the constituency, backed Remain. Ms Olney is expected to be confirmed as the party's pick for the by-election after party leader Tim Farron rejected the idea of parachuting in one of its big names. The Conservatives are not fielding a candidate against Mr Goldsmith, who held the south-west London seat in 2015 with a 23,015 majority. The Lib Dems, who held the seat until 2010, finished second. Labour says it will field a candidate despite three of its MPs urging it to consider standing aside to maximise the chances of a Tory defeat. The Green Party said it was also likely to put forward a candidate although it said it supported \"progressives working together to beat the Conservatives\". In standing down, Mr Goldsmith - who has long campaigned against a third runway - fulfilled a pledge to quit if the government backed the expansion. He said: \"There was no small print, no expiry date, no ambiguity. It was a simple promise. And it mattered. \"\n",

Pre-tax profits on continuing operations were down by 39% to £96m. However, that does not include exceptional items. Post-tax reported profit was down 68% to £44m. The company has had one-off costs of cutting back sharply on its overhead costs, shedding a 10th of its workforce in the first half of this year. Wood Group is currently in a pay dispute with maintenance workers on Shell platforms in the UK North Sea. Chief executive Robin Watson said: \"We have continued to focus on what we can control and what we can manage during a period where lower oil prices have endured and activity has fallen. \"Our focus remains on managing costs, improving efficiency and maintaining capability. We are working with our customers to work smarter, streamlining work processes while increasing quality and efficiency.\" The engineering firm has told investors it expects full year profits to be 20% lower than in 2015. The outlook was helped, it said, by early signs of oil production projects being given approval, and signs that the sharp drop in North American onshore drilling may have bottomed out. Wood Group has also announced a $700m multi-year contract for oilfield automation services in Kazakhstan. This continues work it has been doing there for Tengizchevroil since 2013. In other energy news, Cairn Energy, based in Edinburgh, announced a significant increase in the estimated size of its oil discovery in Senegal. An independent company has assessed it as containing 473 million barrels of potentially recoverable oil or its gas equivalent, and up to 2.7 billion in total in the field. The company said the new North Sea fields in which it has a significant interest, Kraken and Catcher, remain on schedule to be in production by the end of next year. The downturn in the oil market means the capital expenditure behind them has fallen between 10% and 20%.

In fact they haven't even signed a peace treaty and in 66 years they have taken very different paths. No agreements will be signed, no joint statements made, but China's Xi Jinping and Taiwan's Ma Ying-jeou will have an hour-long meeting and a casual dinner afterwards. It could get awkward and here are some of the questions that could crop up. China has hundreds of missiles targeted at Taiwan to warn the island against declaring formal independence. Beijing still considers Taiwan a province to be reunified with the mainland one day and has not renounced the use of force to take it back. In fact, one of the main reasons for its military build-up is to counter possible US assistance to Taiwan if Beijing were to try to take back militarily. Mr. Ma would argue: \"If you want to be friends, you must remove these missiles.\" \"Not that simple,\" Mr Xi might answer. Doing so could embolden pro-independence groups in Taiwan who want the island to be recognised as a completely separate country from China. The meeting will take place less than three months before Taiwan holds presidential and legislative races, but truly democratic elections like these are not in China's vocabulary. Taiwan, on the other hand, has developed into a vibrant democracy and is proud of its system. Over dinner, Mr Ma could share his low approval rating headaches with Mr Xi and even make jokes about how hard it is to finish a speech when protesters are trying to throw shoes at him. Mr Xi might just politely smile and think to himself: \"And you wonder why we run things like we do?\" Mr Xi will be eager to push relations forward. During Mr Ma's seven years in office, the two sides have signed many agreements - from those that have allowed first-ever direct flights to ones that bring millions of Chinese tourists to Taiwan each year, not to mention tariff-cutting trade deals. China is eager to link Taiwan's economy and society even closer to the mainland's, and begin talking about unification. But Mr Ma will have to explain that public opinion does not support more deals and such\n",

Investigators are examining the cause of the crash, which happened as the bus was bound for Los Angeles. Rescuers used ladders to climb into the bus windows to remove bodies. Five of the injured passengers are in critical condition. The Los Angeles Times described the crash as the deadliest in California for several decades. It said that the bus careered into the rear of the truck at high speed, mangling the front third of the bus. Most of those who died were apparently at the front of the bus, the newspaper reported. The driver was among the fatalities. Officials quoted by the paper said that identifying the victims could take days, because some were not carrying identity cards or had lost their belongings when they were taken to hospital. They have warned that it may not be possible to determine exactly why the accident happened because of the driver's death. Investigators will assess whether he might have fallen asleep or had a heart attack, in addition to determining if there was a mechanical failure or some other kind of emergency.

According to the Desert Sun newspaper, the tour bus, run by US Holiday, was coming from Red Earth Casino, near Salton City in California.

Venezuelan Interior Minister Tarek El Aissami said via Twitter that Mr Cholele was in good shape and being taken by police to be reunited with his family.

Reality Check verdict: What, if anything, gets cut if there is a Brexit will be a matter for the government to decide. \"If we restrict our access [to the single market] we will be less well off and that obviously affects what we can spend on our public services,\" he said. In the past few days, voters have been warned that leaving the European Union would have severe effects on different areas of public spending. We've been told both by David Cameron and Labour's Tom Watson that the triple-lock protection on state pensions would be threatened. We've had Chancellor George Osborne warning that Brexit would lead to between £1bn and £1.5bn of cuts to defence spending. He pointed out that even if the government stuck to Nato's target of spending 2% of national income on defence, if national income fell, then so would defence spending. And the prime minister has also warned about spending on the NHS being threatened if the UK left the EU. Why are they making these warnings? Because economic forecasters have said that leaving the European Union would mean the economy would grow by less than it would have done. That would mean lower tax revenues for the government, which would mean it would struggle to achieve a budget surplus as promised in 2019-20. What the government chose to do about that would be a question of policy, as David Cameron confirmed, but that has not stopped various groups having a guess. The Institute for Fiscal Studies predicted the government would decide to delay balancing the budget, bringing in an extra one or two years of austerity at the current rate. Labour In for Britain said the government would attempt to balance the budget in 2019-20, meaning it would need to make savings of £28bn, which would be divided equally between tax rises, departmental spending cuts and cuts to social security spending. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the government would be trying to save an extra £44bn in 2019-20. It is also possible that the government could decide not to balance the budget and borrow more instead. There is a pretty strong consensus that the initial economic shock from a vote to leave the EU would make it harder to achieve a balance in 2019-20, although it could be smaller than some groups have predicted.

But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with \"extreme verve and vigour.\" But one critic of the register said it was \"fake\" and full of \"loopholes\". Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions. The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics. However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working \"in-house\" for companies or organisations. A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall. But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. \"We are having something that has never been in place before,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.\" Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different \"levels of lobbying\". \"The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,\" she said. She added: \"This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain. \"If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.\" Ms White said last\n",

So much so, in fact, that he is prepared to put him among the top five most expensive players in City history. A product of the Benfica academy, Silva is an attacking right-sided midfield player and is, at 22, just the kind of age Guardiola likes - old enough to understand his role, young enough to absorb the intricate tactical lessons his new manager imparts.

ITN chief executive John Hardie said he was a \"true legend\". Nicholson, who died on 11 December, presented reports from around the world on ITV's flagship current affairs programme Tonight. He had four children and three grandchildren. He was known for smuggling an orphaned girl out of Sarajevo while reporting on the conflict - and bringing her back to the UK, where he adopted her. The correspondent met nine-year-old Natasha Mihaljcic while he was working on a story about children being trapped by shelling in the Bosnian capital in 1992. He went on to write a book about the events which was used as the inspiration for the 1997 film Welcome To Sarajevo.

A White House statement later said the leaders had \"affirmed the importance of continued co-operation through multilateral institutions, including Nato\". It said they had \"agreed on the necessity of working collectively to move the transatlantic agenda forward, particularly on bringing stabilisation to the Middle East and North Africa\". On Ukraine, the leaders said the sanctions imposed against Russia must remain in place until Moscow fully met its commitments to resolve the conflict. Western nations accuse Russia of sending its troops and weapons into eastern Ukraine to support separatist fighters - a claim Moscow denies. On Syria, President Obama and the EU leaders said attacks on the city of Aleppo by Syrian government troops and Russia \"should be immediately halted\".

Labour's Lord Alli said its passage meant \"my life and many others will be better today than it was yesterday\". But Tory peer Lord Framlingham said the \"ill-thought through\" change had been \"bulldozed\" through Parliament. Peers approved the principle of same-sex marriage last month, despite efforts by opponents to \"wreck\" the legislation. MPs had earlier done the same, in the face of opposition from many Conservatives, the Church of England and other faith groups. Supporters of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill wore pink carnations during Monday's proceedings in the Lords, during which a series of minor amendments - including one relating to pension benefits for same-sex couples - were proposed. Government minister Lady Stowell said the bill \"puts right something which is wrong\" and had been improved by detailed scrutiny in the Upper House. \"I can't claim to be a gay rights campaigner, but I am a firm believer in justice and fairness,\" she said. But the Gay Marriage No Thanks group claimed it had been prevented from mounting an advertising campaign around Parliament after its truck was vandalised and its driver threatened. After clearing the Lords, the bill will return to the Commons for a short debate on government amendments before the Commons begins its summer recess on Thursday. The bill must then receive Royal Assent before it becomes law.\n",

But within minutes of arriving, there are loud explosions. A man lies seriously wounded on the ground. He's bleeding badly from the head. We learn he's called Andrei and is a journalist working for Russia's military TV channel. A member of the BBC's team starts to treat him. He's joined by two medics from the OSCE. Andrei has lost a lot of blood and his body is shaking violently as he goes into shock. A local woman is screaming hysterically, as blood stains the pavement outside the local shop where he's now lying, and the journalists brought to monitor this peace mission crowd around. The three men treating Andrei manage to stem the bleeding, but there are then exchanges of gunfire nearby. What sound like rocket propelled grenades are also fired. There is no ceasefire here, even when the OSCE are in the village. The BBC-OSCE team gets Andrei into an old green Soviet-era van, and he is driven away to the local hospital. Later we learn he is still alive, but in a serious condition. His colleague tells us that Andrei said he needed the toilet. When he walked behind the shop, we believe he triggered a booby trap. It was a short walk that might have cost him his life, and it was a reminder of how volatile the ceasefire agreement is here. Later we meet two elderly women who are still living in this village on the frontline. Their eyes quickly fill with tears - this is a common scene in eastern Ukraine.\n",

New signing Jerome Leduc scored twice and Mike Forney got the other as the Giants took control of the contest. Mark Richardson gave Cardiff hope and Sean Bentivoglio got it back to 3-2 before Joey Haddard equalised and Patrick Asselin netted the winner. It was a devastating final period for the Giants who had hoped to cut the Devils lead to a single point. Now Derrick Walser's men must pick themselves up immediately as they host Cardiff again in Belfast on Saturday night. As befitting a clash between the top two teams, the game started at a frenetic pace which lasted the entire first period. Both keepers were kept busy but it was the Devils' Ben Bowns who was beaten first as debutant Giant Leduc, signed only this week, finished with aplomb in front of goal to give the home side the lead in the 14th minute. With 48 seconds of the period remaining, a Forney shot sneaked past the unsighted Bowns to raise the roof at the SSE Arena as the Giants snatched a two-goal advantage. Leduc's fine start in a Giants shirt continued in the second period when he slammed in his second goal of the night to make it 3-0 on a Belfast power play. The visitors were not daunted by that deficit and came back hard at the Giants with a number of impressive saves from Stephen Murphy keeping the three-goal margin intact. But there was an almighty twist in the tale. The Devils struck early in the final period as Richardson arrowed the puck into the top corner of the net past Murphy. Now it was the small but vocal contingent of fans from Wales who were making all the noise in the arena as the scoreline became 3-2 as a Bentivoglio shot was deflected into the net off Giants' player-coach Walser, setting up a tense finale. Haddard then made it 3-3 with less than six minutes remaining. Then, incredibly, Patrick Asselin's close-range finish completed a remarkable turnaround by the Devils in what could well have been\n",

They were questioned by a studio audience made up mostly of grassroots supporters and some undecided voters. The debate was simulcast to UK-wide audiences on the BBC News channel. It was hosted by Noel Thompson. An early flashpoint in the debate came between Mike Nesbitt and Arlene Foster over who should be first minister. \"I think that Arlene has a five-word plan - do not mention Peter Robinson,\" said Mr Nesbitt. \"I have a one-point plan - the Ulster Unionist one-point plan is make it work. Make Stormont work.\" Mrs Foster replied: \"Unlike Mike Nesbitt, I remember the bad old days of pushover unionism. \"I remember what it was like in 1998 when we had a concession a day to the IRA, I remember what happened in relation to prisoners, I remember what happened to the RUC.\" David Ford said that the argument over who should be first minister was about trying to frighten people. \"I think it's rather sad that this is now the third election in a row that the DUP's campaign has been based on the politics of fear.

Mr McGuinness accused the SDLP leader of not knowing \"what he wants to do\" over being in government, but Mr Eastwood responded that the election is \"not a coronation\". \"I am going into government.

            "Input: summarize: Offences for which lower compensation was awarded included ones involving drink, drugs or violence. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority said statutory guidance obliged it to reduce or refuse awards if victims had unspent convictions. A leading child abuse lawyer called for a review of the \"scandalous\" approach. Alan Collins said civil case judges increasingly took the opposite view, and accepted that abuse could have a lifelong effect, with addictions being a possible consequence. Since 2010, CICA - an executive agency sponsored by the Ministry of Justice - has awarded compensation to 12,665 people who were sexually abused as children, or as adults lacking mental capacity. But some 438 people have had their government-funded compensation reduced because they had committed criminal offences themselves, the BBC learned after a series of Freedom of Information requests. Of the 27 cases where compensation was reduced between June 2014 and June 2015, half were for drink, drugs, theft or property offences. Eight involved violence against people. CICA would not say how many applications by such victims had been rejected. \"The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme has always asked that awards are reduced or refused if the victim had unspent convictions,\" it said in a statement. The Ministry of Justice said the refusal or reduction of an awarded payment reflected the fact the individual \"may have caused distress, loss or injury to another person, and cost the taxpayer money through a police investigation or court proceedings\". It said there were no plans to review the scheme. Odette Tovey, a Sheffield-based legal representative for several grooming victims whose applications have been rejected by CICA, said: \"The crimes committed against the victims far outweigh the crimes that these victims committed.\" Some of these had been abused for many years, from their early teens, added Ms Tovey, and CICA was their only route to potential compensation. Ms Tovey said CICA needed to take into consideration that victims' crimes \"were as a result of mental health problems developed because of the period of abuse they went through\". Victims could be eligible for compensation of £27,000 if no deductions were made, said Ms Tovey. The average award after CICA compensation reduction was £8,423.

Chris, who works as an electrical wholesaler, strongly believes it was a trip that saved his life. \"I was one of the fortunate ones, just so lucky when I think about it,\" he said. Chris initially thought he may have had an ulcer and was not concerned. \"My health was fine, I was a 40-something rugby player. I worked shifts and thought any tiredness was down to an unusual sleep pattern.\" But after receiving a pinprick test at his local blood clinic in Ballymoney, nurses told Chris that he could not donate blood because his iron levels were unusually low and advised him to visit his local GP who then referred him for a colonoscopy. Chris was then diagnosed with GIST, a rare cancer that occurs in the wall of the stomach and small intestine. Doctors discovered the 9cm (3.5in) tumour in March 2013 and carried out a successful operation at the Royal Victoria Hospital in May. \"I tried to keep things as normal as I could at home, I have two young girls. Thankfully the cancer didn't spread. I had surgery to remove my stomach. I was 16 stone (100kg) before surgery, now I'm 12 stone (79kg).

It was the first back-to back defeats for the Warriors this season, a team who set a new NBA record of 73 wins in the regular season. Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were the stars of the show for the Thunder, but even they were eclipsed by a moment of magic from Adams. The 22-year-old, who scored 11 points and seven rebounds in the win, threw a one-handed bullet pass to Andre Roberson just before half-time. More than 22,000 tweets were sent in an hour about Adams' baseball style throw and the player began trending on Twitter in his native New Zealand and the US. Then there was a young fan who turned up to the game at Oklahoma's Chesapeake Arena, dressed as Adams with a fake moustache and tattoos in tribute to her hero. Many Twitter users felt the youngster was the real star of game four and even Adams himself tweeted that it was \"absolutely amazing\".

Both sides have had their fill of penalty action this week. Carroll scored one for the Hammers before they conceded a late spot-kick and equaliser against Leicester on Sunday. And Watford earned a 1-0 victory over West Brom on Saturday - their first win in seven league games - largely thanks to Heurelho Gomes' two penalty saves.

Noble slotted both penalties home with ease, after Carroll had given the Hammers the lead by poking in from close range after a pinpoint ball from Dimitri Payet.

'With Lyrica, I see people running about like zombies' An ex-drug user, who lost his teenage friend to suicide after a battle with drugs, has told BBC News NI that abuse of Lyrica is \"wrecking lives\".

It is illegal to have class C drugs without a prescription and illegal to supply or sell them to others. The Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs made the recommendation in a letter to ministers, including the then home secretary Theresa May, in January. The letter cited warnings from the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) who highlighted \"significant misuse and abuse\" of the drug.

But it's going to be a bit trickier to see them this year because it's happening at the same time as a supermoon - the third one this year. The light from the closer full moon will make it harder for stargazers. Meteors are small space rocks ranging from the size of a grain of sand to a pea that enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, producing a bright streak of light. Most meteors break off from comets, which are dirty \"snowballs\" mainly made of ice, but the Geminids are different. The object they come from, the 3200 Phaethon, is more like an asteroid. As it orbits, the heat of the Sun causes surface material to crumble, before it tumbles off into space, leaving a trail of rocky debris behind it. The Earth passes through this trail each year as it orbits around the Sun, and we see them glow as the rock burns up in the Earth's atmosphere. You don't need any special equipment to view the meteor shower. Find a clear space away from street lights or the light coming from your house.

The company also forecast higher-than-expected holiday season revenue of between $76bn and $78bn. But revenue in the fourth quarter fell 9% to $46.85bn. That meant annual revenue fell for the first time since 2001, highlighting a slowdown in the smartphone market as well as intensifying competition, particularly from Chinese rivals. Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC Technology correspondent It was no surprise that Apple saw its first fall in annual revenues for 15 years. It became apparent earlier in the year that sales of the iPhone - surely the most profitable product in history - had plateaued and they continued to disappoint this quarter. It was hard to spot any product or market delivering outstanding results - the fact that Apple still hasn't released any figures for its Watch tells its own story - and the 30% fall in China sales looked particularly worrying. But somehow Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook still managed to paint a rosy picture. He pointed to the 24% rise in income from services like Apple Music and Apple Pay. He told us that he was thrilled with the response of customers to the iPhone 7 - and that round the world, including in China, demand was outstripping supply. And crucially he looked forward to a return to growth in the next quarter, with Apple forecasting a record-breaking holiday season. Investors have been looking for reasons to buy back into Apple and that prediction may help continue the recent upward path of the shares. But the technology crowd is still waiting for some radical new innovation, to prove the company founded by Steve Jobs hasn't lost its creative spark. Tim Cook wouldn't be drawn when quizzed about moves into TV or building a car or a connected speaker like the Amazon Echo. He did say \"we have the strongest product pipeline we've ever had\". But that is a line we have been hearing for some time. Apple executives said demand for the new iPhone 7 was strong, despite fiscal fourth-quarter revenue falls in China and the Americas, its two most important markets. Revenue from Greater China, once seen as Apple's next growth hope, fell 30% in the quarter, after dropping 33% in the previous quarter. In the same period last year, revenue\n",

Authorities say that selfies will be banned on the days that people ritually bathe in the sacred Godavari river. Organisers say they conducted a study that showed people took too long taking selfies. This slows down the flow of people, leading to pushing and panic. Signs saying \"no selfie zone\" can be seen around the two festival sites in the state of Maharashtra. The festival takes place every three years. It began in mid-July and runs until late September. The decision was taken after over 100 volunteers conducted a study on behalf of the Kumbhathon group which works with the authorities to help monitor the festival. \"Since 13 July, our volunteers on the field have been collecting data which showed that people stop to take selfies. They also climb to dangerous spots to take selfies,\" Kumbhathon CEO Sandip Shinde told the Indian Express.

The Court of Appeal suggested the Department for Work and Pensions would owe a mere 1% of that amount, £1.3m, to just 2,500 people. The complex judgment on Friday was originally prompted by a challenge from Cait Reilly, a geology graduate from Birmingham. She had argued that requiring her to work at Poundland for no pay constituted a breach of her human rights. The government - to counter such claims - had retrospectively altered the law to validate the docking of benefits. Today, the Court of Appeal ruled that even under that new revised law, the docking of benefits could be incompatible with the European Convention of Human Rights. The Court's ruling represented a defeat for the government. Padraig Hughes, of Public Interest Lawyers, the group that brought Ms Reilly's case, said: \"It is yet a further example of the reckless approach this Government continues to take towards the constitution and the rule of law.\" The Court of Appeal judges did nevertheless acknowledge that government ministers can change laws to affect cases retrospectively. And the judges decided that the only rights infringed upon where those of people that had already claimed the benefits docking was unfair. This narrowing of the claimants explains why only a tiny fraction of people will be eligible for a payout. \"We are considering the judgment\", a DWP spokesman said. \"It is only right that jobseekers do all they can to find work while claiming benefits.\" It is not clear yet whether either side will make a further appeal.\n",

The vote is not binding on MPs but Jeremy Corbyn has said the party must heed the opinion of members. It follows calls from a senior Labour figure for a free vote in Parliament. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told a meeting hosted by The Guardian at the Labour conference that Syria and the renewal of Trident were issues on which he did not expect consensus within the party and he believed a vote on military action in Syria should be made \"on the basis of conscience\". The government was defeated in 2013 in a parliamentary vote on military action in Syria, but ministers have since said the case for UK intervention in the country should be made again. In 2014 MPs voted in favour of RAF air strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq. Labour's new leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for a UN security council resolution and a fresh diplomatic push to end the violence in Syria. The Labour conference will also consider an emergency motion, tabled by the union Unite, opposing the extension of the RAF's campaign against IS into Syria without \"clear and unambiguous\" authorisation from the UN. But Mr McDonnell told a meeting on the fringe of the conference that many MPs did not back the leader's stance and said it may be necessary for them to \"agree that we can't agree\" - though he said that efforts to reach a consensus within the party were still ongoing. Mr McDonnell said: \"When you are sending people to potential loss of life, I think it is a conscience decision. It is a moral decision. \"On Syria, my view is it should be a free vote on the basis of conscience.\" Prime Minister David Cameron has indicated he would like to extend the RAF airstrikes against the Islamic State group into Syria and could gain parliamentary backing from rebel Labour MPs, even if the party's leadership refuses to offer its support.

            "Input: summarize: Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) said rock was dug away from cliffs near Bearreraig Bay in an apparent organised search for valuable specimens. The agency said Skye was known as Scotland's \"Dinosaur Isle\" because of its important fossil records. SNH has appealed for witnesses to contact the police. Skye is a key dinosaur fossil site in Scotland. Bearreraig Bay, north of Portree, is within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A crowbar is suspected to have been used to prise away some of the rock. Dinosaur footprints may also have been removed from Valtos on Skye, SNH said. Evidence gathered at Valtos has been used by palaeontologists to explain what has been called the Dino Stampede in Australia, an incident where a group of dinosaurs were pursued by a predator. SNH said the Bearreraig Bay dig had been done without the landowner's permission or the consent of SNH, which manages the SSSI. Dr Colin MacFadyen, SNH's geologist, also said the actions went against guidelines in the Scottish Fossil Code. The codes does allow for the use of mechanical diggers, rock saws and even explosives for extracting fossils, but only when it was to the benefit of palaeontological research. Dr MacFadyen said: \"Fossil collecting is important for scientific and educational purposes, and is a popular hobby. \"It is better for fossils that fall from cliffs to be found, collected and enjoyed rather than be eroded and washed away by the tide. \"However, speeding up the process by large scale rock removal as in this alarming case is irresponsible and illegal, and also potentially dangerous to people as the cliff faces are undermined and destabilised.\" Dr MacFadyen said permission to remove material from the SSSI would have been needed from SNH, but it had not been sought.

Mayor Olaf Scholz said the attack was motivated by \"hate\" but did not say it was a terror attack. There are unconfirmed reports that the man shouted \"Allahu akhbar\", Arabic for \"God is great\" while attacking people. Police said they were still seeking to confirm his current nationality. Mr Sholz said he was a failed asylum seeker. The man attacked customers in the supermarket at random, ran outside and was chased by customers and by people outside the shop. They brought him to the ground before he was detained by plain-clothes police officers. Mobile phone footage on German media that is purportedly of the attack's aftermath shows several people chasing a man and throwing chairs at him. A 50-year-old woman and four men aged between 19 and 64 were stabbed, while a 35-year-old man was injured while helping overcome the suspect. The attack happened in the Barmbek region in the north of the city in a branch of Edeka, Germany's largest supermarket chain. Police say the man's weapon may have looked like a machete but they are, for now, assuming it was a kitchen knife. One eyewitness made a gesture about 50cm (20 in) long when asked on German TV how big the knife was. Asked whether this was a terror attack, a police official told the BBC: \"We are at an early stage of the investigation... At the moment we can't rule anything out. We are investigating all avenues.\" Speculation in German media said the attack may have been part of a robbery attempt but police said that that motive could not be confirmed. One eyewitness, who ran from the scene into a nearby shop as the situation unfolded, told German broadcaster NTV that it seemed \"hectic and confused, not like a properly planned attack\".\n",

He has gone with that figure despite a letter from the head of the UK statistics watchdog Sir Andrew Dilnot on Thursday, which described it as \"potentially misleading\". The figure used is roughly the UK's gross contribution to the EU - the amount that would be contributed to the EU Budget were it not for the rebate. We say \"roughly the UK's gross contribution\" because the annual figure that Boris Johnson used was £20bn, somewhat higher than the £18.8bn figure for 2014 - the most recent figure available - while the £350m a week figure is a bit below the actual figure of £361m. The important point is that it's not the sum we send to Brussels because the rebate is deducted before any money is paid. In 2014, the UK's contribution to the EU budget - the amount we paid to Brussels - was actually £276m a week. If Britain were to give up the rebate, then the UK would have to pay the gross contribution, and it should be noted that the rebate is not a permanent feature of Britain's membership of the EU. But we do not pay the gross contribution at the moment, the rebate is safe until 2020, and Britain has a veto over the process that would remove or reduce it. Sir Andrew Dilnot is particularly concerned about suggestions from Vote Leave that a sum of money equivalent to the gross contribution could be spent on other priorities such as the NHS, when some of it is not spent at all (the rebate) and some of it is currently used to support UK farmers, for example.

That match against the Saints was the final league victory under Silva's predecessor Mike Phelan, who was dismissed on 3 January with the team bottom of the league. Hull have now won twice in three games under former Olympiakos and Sporting Lisbon boss Silva, having beaten Swansea in the FA Cup third round a week ago. Tyrone Mings' own goal added gloss to the scoreline for Hull, who took a long time to grow into the match after falling behind to Junior Stanislas' third-minute penalty, awarded for Harry Maguire's challenge on Ryan Fraser and the 10th the Tigers have conceded in 21 games this season. Bournemouth have now shipped three goals in eight of their last 10 games in all competitions, and drop to 11th place after their 10th defeat of the campaign. It has been a bleak winter for Hull so far and the loss of £10m striker Hernandez to injury certainly contributed to their plight. The Tigers went nine games without a win during his absence, dropping them to the bottom of the table by Christmas and culminating in the departure of Phelan early in the new year. His return has coincided with the appointment of Silva, and it has quickly become apparent that the influence of both could prove vital in turning Hull's season around. The 26-year-old's goal against Swansea in the cup was a timely reminder of the ability that brought him 20 goals in Hull's promotion campaign last season, and his first against Bournemouth bore all the predatory instincts that the hosts have been missing these past few weeks. Huge credit must go to Andrew Robertson for the quality of his cross from the left wing, which presented Hernandez with a headed chance from around a yard out that he simply could not miss. The second was more of a self-made effort, the Uruguay international picking the ball up on the right, advancing into the area and selling a couple of cute stepovers to Mings before curling a precise finish into the left-hand corner.

And Cairney found the only goal of the game, picking up the ball on the edge of the box and rifling a low shot into the back of the net. The first real piece of action was for the visitors and their front man Stephen Dobbie. He won the ball from Peter Murphy, but he dragged his shot wide of the target. Minutes later Mark Millar tried his luck for Queens, but his shot was saved by the legs of Greg Fleming in the Ayr goal. The next clear cut chance came just before the half time whistle. Jordan Marshall slipped away from his marker, he whipped in a great ball from the left, but Dobbie couldn't get his head to it.

Government sources say the main figure arrested is Saleh Makki, a hitherto relatively unknown member of the political opposition with no association with rebels in the past.

A bus filled with a wedding party taking the bride to the groom's home was stopped at a routine checkpoint on 12 February near the southern Ethiopian town of Shashamane. Local police told revellers to turn off the nationalistic Oromo music playing. They refused and the bus drove off. The situation then rapidly escalated and reports indicate at least one person died and three others were injured after police fired shots. The exact details of the incident are hard to verify, but what is clear is that days of protest followed, including armed local militia clashing with federal police, leaving seven policemen dead, the government says. Oromia at a glance: Why Ethiopia is making a historic ‘master plan’ U-turn Since last November, Ethiopia has seen a third phase of the recent unrest in the Oromia region which has been unprecedented in its longevity and geographical spread. The region is the largest in Ethiopia and the Oromos, who make up a third of the population, are the biggest of the country's more than 80 ethnic groups. Initially the protests were in reaction to a plan to expand the administrative border of the capital, Addis Ababa, which is encircled by Oromia. But even after the region's governing party, the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation, which is part of Ethiopia's governing coalition, shelved the plan in January, protests have continued. \"There is a strong sense of victimhood, extending back 150 years,\" says Daniel Berhane, a prominent Addis Ababa-based political blogger, covering Ethiopia for the website Horn Affairs. \"People remember the history. The scars are still alive, such as how the Oromo language was suppressed until 20 years ago.\" Despite there being an ethnic basis to these protests, observers say that the deeper issues behind them, frustrations over land ownership, corruption, political and economic marginalisation, are familiar to many disenchanted Ethiopians.

Specialist teams are also turning away up to a quarter of youngsters, it said. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the government was \"determined to address\" mental health problems. The previous coalition government promised in 2015 an extra £250m a year during this parliament to improve mental health services for children in England. However, Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb - who was a health minister at the time - has now overseen a report by an independent commission that says much of the money has failed to reach the areas where it is most needed. The report - by the Education Policy Institute Independent Commission on Children and Young People's Mental Health - says only £75m made it to the clinical commissioning groups who pay for services last year. The commission says young people are still struggling to access help - partly because of difficulties in recruiting staff, including mental health nurses and psychiatrists. According to the report, specialist services are turning away 23% of children and young people referred to them, often because there are \"high thresholds\" for accessing services. The authors warned that \"something has to go drastically wrong before some services will intervene\". The report challenged Theresa May to develop a \"prime minister's challenge on children's mental health\", similar to former PM David Cameron's \"dementia challenge\", which led to increases in investment and awareness. Mr Lamb, chairman of the commission, said: \"The prime minister, in her very first speech, rightly highlighted the inadequacies of the country's mental health provision as a 'burning injustice'. \"Today we call on the government to meet this commitment - and take urgent action to ensure children and young people with mental health problems receive the care they need.\" Bev Humphrey, chairwoman of the Mental Health Network - which represents mental health and learning disability service providers in England - said the government had failed \"to come close to fulfilling its existing promises on mental health funding\". \"This situation means underfunded NHS and social services are struggling to help the growing number of children experiencing serious mental health problems. \"With many services almost at breaking point the commission is right - it really is time to deliver.\" Mr Hunt said mental health services for children remained\n",

And their mood would not have been helped if Anthony Pilkington's header had not been deflected over with barely a minute on the clock. Ameobi and a Peter Whittingham free-kick went close for Cardiff before midfielder Ralls' 25-yard shot cannoned back off the post. Charlton's Reza Ghoochannejhad tested Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall before an unmarked Jackson headed Gudmundsson's corner into the ground and over. Pilkington twice worried the Charton defence either side of the interval before the Cardiff striker hit the crossbar when his clever flick from Scott Malone's cross had home keeper Stephen Henderson beaten. But Charlton, with the second worst defensive record in the league, held firm and the hosts could have won their first home game since early November in added time. Zakarya Bergdich forced Marshall into a smart save before Cardiff defender Bruno Ecuele Manga cleared Makienok's effort off the line as the Welsh side drew their 13th match this season, the joint highest in the whole league.

He was once an ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan but has now been accused of plotting to overthrow the Turkish government - a claim the cleric strongly denies. The US is thought to be unlikely to act on any extradition request. The move comes amid a national crackdown on perceived supporters of the cleric. Over 20 journalists working for media outlets thought to be sympathetic to the Gulen movement were arrested last weekend. Eight of them were freed on Friday on the orders of a court in Istanbul. Those released include Ekrem Dumanli, editor-in-chief of Zaman newspaper. Four others, including a TV station boss, remain in custody. According to the BBC's Mark Lowen in Istanbul, it was expected that the authorities would go after Mr Gulen after having targeted those linked to him. While the US and Turkey have an extradition agreement, the warrant is considered to be largely symbolic - and unlikely to be acted upon. The relationship between Washington and Ankara has grown fractious, though they remain allies. Mr Erdogan has faced criticism from international leaders and his opponents, who accuse him of authoritarianism and undermining free press. Many abroad believe that the charges against Mr Gulen are politically motivated. The wealthy cleric, who operates an international network of schools and businesses, has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. According to media reports, the prosecutor filing the arrest warrant accused Mr Gulen of leading an armed terrorist group - a charge that carries up to 15 years in prison.\n",

But there was support for the idea of more powers being devolved to the Welsh Assembly, with 49% in favour. ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,006 people in Wales over the telephone. The survey found 12% wanted to see the assembly abolished. The poll also found growing support for UKIP in Wales ahead of next year's general election. Nigel Farage's party is on 14%, up seven points from the last BBC Wales poll in March. Labour are down four points to 38%, with the Conservatives on 23% (down one), Plaid Cymru on 13% (down one) and the Liberal Democrats on 7% (down two). Prof Roger Scully of the Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University said: \"Support for independence is the lowest I've seen anywhere. \"There has been a clear move towards supporting more powers, and some of the people who may have said 'independence' have gone in that direction. \"We're getting close to a majority saying they want things to go further. There are also pretty low levels of support for abolition of the assembly - the extreme positions are losing out.\" An analysis of the voting intention figures by Prof Scully suggests that, on a uniform swing, Labour would gain two seats in the capital - Cardiff North and Cardiff Central - at next May's general election. The Conservatives would lose Cardiff North but gain Brecon and Radnor; Plaid Cymru would retain their three seats but the Liberal Democrats would be reduced to a solitary Welsh seat at Westminster - Ceredigion. UKIP's level of support is too low to win their own seat, but high enough to have an impact on some marginal constituencies. \"UKIP's support is clearly going up,\" said Prof Scully. \"They are starting to reach the sort of level where they could make a serious difference in marginal seats.\" He said most evidence suggests they are taking more support from the Conservatives than anywhere else, which could be of importance in Tory-held marginal seats like the Vale of Glamorgan and Aberconwy.

A senior IS leader was also said to have been killed east of the city. Government forces have encircled Ramadi and are preparing for a final assault on the city, which IS overran in May. Last week, troops retook the key western district of Tamim, which is only separated from the city centre by a tributary of the Euphrates, and the headquarters of the Iraqi military's Anbar Operations Command. On Monday, a senior source in the Anbar Operations Command said IS militants launched a wave of attacks across Ramadi as they tried to regain areas recently recaptured by government forces. Five suicide bombers drove cars packed with explosives at government positions, including those in the northern district of Albu Farraj, killing more than 20 soldiers and tribesmen, the source added. At least 15 militants were subsequently killed in a gun battle, before Iraqi and US-led air strikes forced the rest of the attackers to retreat. A sixth suicide car bomb attack, in south-western Ramadi, killed another 15 soldiers and tribesmen, the source said. Iraqi media also reported that an IS leader in charge of setting up car bombs had been killed along with four of his aides in a military operation in the Jazirat al-Khalidiya area, 12 miles (20km) east of Ramadi. Security sources identified the militant as Ibrahim al-Halabi, a Syrian national. The US military believes there are between 600 and 1,000 IS militants in Ramadi.

Power was restored to Adelaide area by 03:00 local time (17:30 GMT) but tens of thousands of homes remain cut off. On Thursday, authorities advised people to leave work early as winds were expected to intensify again. How 'unprecedented' storm played out The state premier said \"twin tornadoes\" had hit northern areas in \"an extreme weather event\" on Wednesday. Jay Weatherill compared the storm to Hurricane Sandy which hit New York in 2012. He said officials in charges of the power grid had told him \"any system would not be able to cope with a weather system of this kind\". \"We had winds which were so strong that when they hit power lines they created such energy they were tearing the towers out of the ground.\" While South Australia's wild weather was widely forecast, no-one could really predict the impact it would have on everyday life. In Adelaide, commuters were left feeling their way in the dark as the lights went off on their way home. Gridlock followed, as trains and trams came to a standstill. At the airport, some passengers had to depend on handwritten boarding passes, after power for the printers failed. Some describe the whole experience as \"apocalyptic\", while one woman, who was on the operating table in the local hospital and about to undergo surgery, said it was simply \"funny\". What has been predictable is that an extreme weather event has very quickly turned into an Australian political storm, with the state's dependency on renewable energy now being debated with the full force and bluster of a tornado. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said the storm was a once-in-50-years event. It is forecasting further heavy rainfall throughout Thursday and into Friday. Further gales of up to 140km/h (87mph) are expected, and flood warnings remain in place.

Officials say strong winds and heavy rains caused the crane to fall. Correspondents say there have previously been concerns about safety on Saudi construction sites. The Grand Mosque, known as the Masjid al-Haram, is the largest mosque in the world and surrounds Islam's holiest place, the Kaaba. At least 230 people were injured in the incident. It is unclear how many people were hurt by the collapse or the stampede that followed it. Those killed are reported to include Indonesian, Indian, Iranian and Egyptian citizens. The incident happened at 17:23 local time (14:23 GMT) on Friday. Videos posted online showed the moment the structure collapsed, with a loud crash followed by panic and shouting. Bodies and blood could be seen on the floor of the mosque. The head of Saudi Arabia's civil defence agency, Lt Sulayman Bin-Abdullah al-Amr, said an investigation was being carried out to assess the damage, and the \"extent of the safety of these sites\". Essam al-Ghalib, a Jeddah-based journalist, said the crane fell through the outer ring of the Grand Mosque and punctured through the roof sending down tonnes of cement and debris onto people either praying or walking through. Up to two million people are expected to arrive in Mecca for the Hajj from all over the world later this month. Saudi officials say the crane disaster will not prevent the Hajj going ahead. Irfan Al-Alawi, from the Islamic Heritage Research Foundation, told the BBC that the Grand Mosque is currently surrounded by 15 large cranes amid major redevelopment work. \"The entire area is like a salvage yard,\" Mr Al-Alawi said. \"Saudi Arabia has to re-think its health and safety strategy,\" he said, \"as there were 800,000 people in the mosque area at the time of the accident.\" The original parts of the Grand Mosque date back 1,400 years.

It speaks of Britain's \"almost moribund political culture\". Conservative MP Conor Burns said the letter was \"naive\", but David Cameron said he welcomed the move. The 52-page letter - an unprecedented intervention by the House of Bishops - says \"it is the duty of every Christian adult to vote, even though it may have to be a vote for something less than a vision that inspires us\". The Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham James, said there was \"disengagement with the contemporary political culture\" and rejected the pleas of some, such as comedian and actor Russell Brand, for people not to vote. He told reporters: \"We as bishops are not as sexy as Russell Brand but we say 'do vote, do engage and do use the hard-won political freedoms that you possess'.\" The letter says the country needs \"a new approach to political life that will change the political weather as decisively as did the administrations of 1945 and 1979\". \"The ideals that the Big Society stood for should not be consigned to the political dustbin,\" the letter adds. The Big Society was among the Conservatives' flagship 2010 election policies and encouraged greater personal responsibility and community activism in shaping society and running public services. But by January 2013 charities expressed \"huge frustration\" at a lack of progress with the idea, which they said appeared to be \"going nowhere\".

They say that the two UK administrations that offered genuinely new visions - Clement Attlee's Labour party in 1945 and Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives in 1979 - changed the way people in Britain looked at society, politics and the role of government and human relationships - but that today, neither vision addresses contemporary needs, at a time of increasing public alienation from mainstream politics.

Protesters lost their appeal to the Supreme Court earlier this month. Transport Minister Keith Brown said the \"unwanted delays\" had resulted in a \"substantial increase\" in the overall cost of the project. William Walton from the protest group RoadSense, which spearheaded the legal challenge against the construction of the bypass, told BBC Scotland he believed the total cost could be even higher. It is anticipated that construction will get under way in 2014, with completion by spring 2018. In answer to a parliamentary question lodged by Aberdeen Central SNP MSP Kevin Stewart, Mr Brown said the scheme had been costed at £347m in 2008 - an estimate based on 2003 prices. He said that the figure had now risen to £653m as a result of \"scope changes, the inclusion of standard risk costs and rebasing to 2012 prices\". Mr Brown said inflation had been responsible for a £230m increase in the cost. A scheme to make the A90 a dual carriageway between Balmedie and Tipperty in Aberdeenshire is also expected to cost £92m, giving a total of £745m for the combined project. Mr Stewart criticised the added costs caused by the legal challenges. He said: \"Not only has an essential piece of infrastructure been delayed unnecessarily, but inflation has driven up costs. \"Now that the legal challenges have been exhausted, we can now move towards construction as quickly as possible.\" Aberdeen City Council leader Barney Crockett said: \"We realised that the cost of the AWPR (Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route) would be roughly what it now is and we have made adequate provision for that. \"The economic performance of the area will be underpinned by the AWPR.\" Tom Smith, chairman of Aberdeen City and Shire Economic Future (Acsef) business development agency, said: \"The delays caused by the legal challenges were always going to impact on the costs outlined in 2003. \"However, the economic and other benefits of the road are so significant that the cost will still represent a major return on investment for the public purse and people of the north east. \"The final mechanics of how they will\n",

Ms Eagle, who was greeted with loud cheers as she stood up at the despatch box, said Mr Cameron had been \"jetting all over the place\" on his \"seemingly endless European tour\", adding to laughter from Labour ranks: \"Can I ask the chancellor: How's it all going?\" \"The good news is we have a leader who is respected abroad,\" replied Mr Osborne, saying the PM was \"fighting for a better deal for Britain, something that would never have happened had there been a Labour government\". George Osborne, the bookies' favourite to replace David Cameron as Conservative leader, was then asked whether he really aspired to be \"the first post-EU prime minister\" by Ms Eagle, who quoted some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs as being \"pretty unimpressed by how it's going\". She then imitated Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's PMQs approach of reading out questions from emails he has received. In this case it was \"Donald from Brussels\" - a reference to EU Council president Donald Tusk, who warned of the \"destabilising\" effect of uncertainty over the UK's future in Europe in a letter to fellow EU leaders this week. Mr Osborne said the UK had received the \"lion's share\" of EU investment since announcing its EU referendum plans. George Osborne went on to say \"someone called Tony\" has been writing today, referred her to comments from former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, who said in an interview published today that the current state of the party was a complete \"tragedy\". Ms Eagle, who is shadow business secretary, was ready with an alternative Blair quote: \"Just mouth the words five more Tory years and you feel your\n",

Councillor Stewart Bell said by the end of the latest rollout, 94% of homes in the region should have access. He added that a range of groups were working on ways to deliver superfast services to those not covered by that programme. There have been concerns in the past that the region was missing out despite major investment in broadband. Mr Bell said there were technical reasons why some sites would not see their services improve. \"Over very long distances the speeds run down a bit and therefore there are some premises that are very distant from cabinets that won't see a significant improvement in services,\" he said. \"The target for this superfast scheme which will be fully operational between 2017 and 2018 is to get 94% of premises in the Borders connected. \"The remaining 6% is something that is being considered by Digital Scotland and Community Broadband Scotland in co-operation with local authorities to see if we can come up with customised local solutions.\"\n",

One critic said it did not stop the \"cycle of crime\", however, the National Police Chiefs' Council said it was \"a cost effective tactic\". A Home Office spokesman said it was \"an operational matter for police\". Informants can get anything from a few pounds for basic information, up to several thousand pounds for helping break up organised crime. Payments are typically used to solve - or prevent - crimes including murder, terrorism and serious sexual offences, and can also be made to recover valuable stolen items. Ronnie Howard, a former undercover police officer, said he made regular payments to informants, and in one case paid out £15,000 over 12 months in order to recover £3m worth of cannabis. He said informants were usually recruited after being arrested and offered either money or a possible sentencing deal in court in return for information supplied. Figures obtained by 5 live Breakfast, under a freedom of information request revealed 41 forces in England and Wales collectively paid £19.59m to informants between 2011 and 2016. The Police Service of Northern Ireland spent almost £2m during the same period while Police Scotland, who only released figures for 2013-16, revealed it had spent £565,248. There are no statistics available to show how many convictions have come as a result of paying informants - or covert human intelligence sources as they are officially known - but the National Police Chiefs' Council defended the practice. Deputy Chief Constable Roger Bannister said: \"The intelligence provided helps to prevent and solve the most serious of crimes and is vital in bringing offenders to justice through the courts. \"This is a well-established and highly regulated, worthwhile, and cost effective tactic, with the money paid to informants being very closely scrutinised.\" But, Neil Wood, who worked as an undercover police officer and ran many informants, said the tactic has its limitations. \"It can be effective for certain crimes but for others - such as the war on drugs - using informants merely ensures that the cycle of violence and brutality continues,\" he said. \"Nobody wants to inform on the drug lords because of fears of violent reprisals, so it's only the low-lying fruit that gets caught out -\n",

Suwaiba Mumuni, whose baby is among the five missing, told the BBC she believes her child is still alive. The hospital, the second largest in Ghana, has denied the allegations. The BBC's Sammy Darko in the capital, Accra, says the case of the missing babies has caused outrage in Ghana. Youths stormed the hospital in Kumasi, 270km (167 miles) north-west of Accra, on Thursday, temporarily closing the maternity wards, he says. Ms Mumuni said after she gave birth on 5 February, she was told that her baby was stillborn and it was taken away by attendants. When her relatives arrived later in the day to collect the body for burial, it could not be found, she said. \"The only news I am expecting to hear is that my baby has been found,\" Ms Mumuni told the BBC. \"They told me my baby is dead, but they have not been able to produce the body... I am confident my baby is alive.\" The bodies of another four babies allegedly delivered stillborn that day are also missing. \"The ministry will leave no stone unturned until the truth is established,\" Health Minister Sherry Ayittey said in a statement. Ms Ayittey said the hospital had 14 working days to find the bodies of the babies \"for burial by the families\". Staff at the hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they often felt overwhelmed and there were inadequate resources to deal with demand.

So how did this final half hour unfold? Germanwings flight 4U 9525 took off from Barcelona Airport in Spain heading for Duesseldorf, Germany, with 150 people on board, at 09:00 GMT on 24 March. The Airbus 320 began travelling over the sea towards France, taking about half an hour to climb to 38,000ft (11,600m). It should have been a two-hour flight and, in the first 20 minutes, the pilots could be heard discussing the stop-over at Barcelona with a flight attendant. At 09:30 the plane made its final contact with air traffic control - a routine message about permission to continue on its route. Everything seemed to be going as planned. Shortly afterwards, the captain told the co-pilot he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications. The cockpit door is heard opening and closing on the recording. Seconds later, shortly before 09:31, the selected altitude was changed from 38,000 ft to 100 ft and the plane began its descent. At 09:33, the plane's speed increased. Air traffic control contacted the co-pilot - and continued to do so over the coming minutes - but received no answer. A buzzer requesting access to the cockpit sounded at 09:34. Knocking and muffled voices asking for the door to be opened can be heard until the end of the recording. At 09:39, \"noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions\" over the course of a minute. The flight crew of another plane also tried to make contact with the cockpit by radio around this time. In the next minute - 93 seconds before impact - \"low amplitude inputs\" on the co-pilot's flight controls were recorded. But the level of movement was too low to disengage the autopilot, so the input made no change to the flight path. The \"Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up, Pull up\" warning was triggered at 09:40: 41 and it continues until the end of the recording at 09:41:06.

The killers accused the boy of trying to steal a bicycle rickshaw van in the north-eastern city of Sylhet. Three people have been detained, including the main suspect who fled to Saudi Arabia after the attack. Suspected thieves are often attacked by mobs in Bangladesh. But the BBC's South Asia editor, Joanna Jolly, says that the brutality of the assault has caused widespread outrage and led to police forming a special squad to investigate the killing. One of the attackers filmed the assault on Samiul Alam Rajon on Wednesday on his mobile phone, while the others tied the boy to a pole and hit him repeatedly with a metal rod. He screamed for help, the Daily Star reported, and cried for water as he begged for his life. The men can be heard laughing and jeering at him as they told him that they would post the video on Facebook. After the boy was killed, the attackers took his body to a secluded dump, the paper reported, about 600ft (180m) away from the torture spot. But they were spotted by some locals who chased them. Three of the group escaped, but one man was caught and handed over to the police. Another was later detained, while the main suspect was arrested in Saudi Arabia. \"It's a sad and unfortunate incident,\" Bangladesh's Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal was quoted by bdnews.24 as saying. \"One [man] has been remanded and another has been arrested. The rest will be arrested soon. None will be spared.\" An autopsy report said that Samiul - who helped his family to sell vegetables - died of a brain haemorrhage after sustaining head injuries.

            "Input: summarize: Now, on the surface, these words from Michael Gove shouldn't be surprising. A minister wouldn't advertise disunity. The surprise though is that - as one of the most prominent Leave campaigners - he was talking about an implementation period post-Brexit which could last for an unspecified amount of time. Insiders say his arrival at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and dealing with the powerful farming lobby may have influenced his view. Some of the most prominent Remain ministers have been expressing relief - tinged in one case with just a hint of triumphalism - that they think in recent weeks that they have managed to sell the idea of a soft landing - or as some say \"no cliff edge\" - after the UK leaves the EU in 2019 to some of their more sceptical colleagues. So much for unity. Where do differences still lie? It was interesting that, in answering my question on whether freedom of movement would continue under an implementation period, that Michael Gove didn't rule this out. Migration, he argued, would be decided by the needs of the economy. But for how long? The tectonic plates may have moved on a transitional deal but its duration is where cabinet fault lines persist. Liam Fox has been pretty clear he doesn't want to contemplate anything more than two years. As one minister put it - he has waited forty years to leave the EU so two more won't matter. But anther prominent cabinet Brexiteer told me he thought it would be a \"disaster\" if the implementation period hadn't concluded by the assumed date of the next election in 2022 while others have talked about anything up to a four year period. Then what form will any transition take? Could there be temporary membership of the European Economic Area? Some leavers might be suspicious that temporary would become permanent. Should we stay in the customs union a bit longer until we hammer out a bespoke deal post Brexit? The EU is unlikely to get the clarity it seeks until there is clarity around the cabinet table. So while some Remainer ministers I have spoken to this week were upbeat, relaxed and chipper - and believe that British business is making its influence felt - many issues remain unresolved\n",

The tech company's DeepMind division said its software had beaten its human rival five games to nil. One independent expert called it a breakthrough for AI with potentially far-reaching consequences. The achievement was announced to coincide with the publication of a paper, in the scientific journal Nature, detailing the techniques used. Earlier on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive had said its own AI project had been \"getting close\" to beating humans at Go. But the research he referred to indicated its software was ranked only as an \"advanced amateur\" and not a \"professional level\" player. Go is thought to date back to ancient China, several thousand years ago. Using black-and-white stones on a grid, players gain the upper hand by surrounding their opponents pieces with their own. The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves compared with about 20 in chess. There are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe, according to DeepMind's team. It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct. DeepMind's chief executive, Demis Hassabis, said its AlphaGo software followed a three-stage process, which began with making it analyse 30 million moves from games played by humans. \"It starts off by looking at professional games,\" he said. \"It learns what patterns generally occur - what sort are good and what sort are bad. If you like, that's the part of the program that learns the intuitive part of Go. \"It now plays different versions of itself millions and millions of times, and each time it gets incrementally better. It learns from its mistakes. \"The final step is known as the Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is really the planning stage. \"Now it has all the intuitive knowledge about which positions are good in Go, it can make long-range plans.\" Tested against rival Go-playing AIs, Google's system won 499 out of 500 matches, And last October, DeepMind invited Fan Hui, Europe's top player, to its London office\n",

The dinosaur's missing foot was found at the beach by palaeontology student, Sam Davies, of Bridgend, at the beginning of this month. \"My first reaction was that I was very lucky,\" he said. The fossilised skeleton of the theropod - a distant cousin of the giant Tyrannosaurus rex - went on display at the National Museum Cardiff's main hall in June after it was found by fossil-hunting brothers Nick and Rob Hanigan. Mr Davies, who studies at the University of Portsmouth, visited Lavernock, near Penarth, after his tutor told him its cliffs were rich with fossils. He arrived only hours after a cliff fall had exposed the fossil and before it could be washed away by the tide. \"It was pure luck that I found it. It was just sitting on top of a slab of rock,\" he said. His tutor, Dr David Martill, confirmed the find was the missing foot of the recently discovered dinosaur, after the student emailed a picture. Dr Martill said: \"This was a chance-in-a-million find and highlights how important it is to encourage fossil hunting in this country.\" He said the specimen would help chart the evolution of dinosaur feet. The foot has been donated to the Amgueddfa Cymru, which hopes to put it on display with the rest of the skeleton soon. Dr Caroline Buttler, head of palaeontology at the museum, said: \"The dinosaur found by Nick and Rob Hanigan is the first skeleton of a theropod found in Wales. \"Sam's find adds to its significance because we can learn more about the animal and how it is related to the dinosaurs that eventually evolved into birds.\"\n",

Mrs Little Pengelly spent a number of hours going door-to-door to meet local residents on Monday evening, and afterwards spoke to the BBC. \"There were some people who were very supportive of the flags, people who felt very much it was part of the tradition of the local area and the wider area,\" she said. \"The majority of people said to me: 'We understand that the flags have gone up, but we also understand that they will come back down again'. \"Really they didn't want a public fuss around this matter,\" she added. \"And there were some who had concerns around this, who would prefer for the flags not to be there. \"The way I would put this is that it was a much more complex picture than I was imagining. \"There were some concerns raised, I reassured those individuals that I would be here to support them as well, I would represent their views to the housing association.\" The housing developments are near the Ravenhill and Cregagh roads, which border the South Belfast and East Belfast constituencies.

Reuters news agency quotes Kenyan women's rights group Equality Now as saying that Mr Ngila has been charged with attempted murder, but there has been no independent confirmation of this. \"This is a particularly shocking case for Kenya... even though domestic violence is rampant,\" Naitore Nyamu of Equality Now told Reuters. \"We can't afford to let the perpetrators act with impunity - which has sometimes been the case in recent years,\" she added. The chairwoman of Kenya's Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Josephine Mong'are, said cases of violence against women had been \"escalating\" and police should ensure that \"all culprits are brought to book\". \"FIDA Kenya reiterates that violence against women is unacceptable and must not be condoned in society,\" she said.\n",

            "Input: summarize: First up, it's the scandal that refuses to burn out - the Belfast Telegraph and News Letter both carry stories relating to that rather infamous heat scheme on their front pages. \"£2.5m fraud probed in just one RHI case\" says the Belfast Telegraph, reporting that energy watchdog Ofgem is investigating a suspected multi-million pound claim to the scheme. According to the paper, it's been suggested it would take four biomass boilers running non-stop every day for 20 years to rack up a £2.5m claim. That's a lot of heat. Meanwhile, the News Letter leads on the news that the public inquiry into the scheme will not sit for any public hearings before March's assembly election. It reports that Finance Minister Máirtn  Muilleoir has confirmed that Sir Patrick Coughlin will chair a three-person panel into the scheme. Judging by events just in the last month or so, the panel has its work cut out. Elsewhere, the News Letter dedicates the rest of its front page, and three pages inside, to what it describes as Stormont's condemnation of a \"missing man bail scandal\". The debate at Stormont was inspired by the case of Damien Joseph McLaughlin, a man charged in connection with the murder of prison officer David Black who has gone missing after being bailed. Meanwhile, all the papers on Wednesday dedicate at least some space to yesterday's Supreme Court judgment over Brexit, with the Belfast Telegraph and Irish News both calling for unity among Northern Ireland's politicians over the Article 50 saga. \"(Northern Ireland's MPs) may not agree on whether leaving the EU is a good or bad move,\" says the Belfast Telegraph. \"But they must speak with one voice in ensuring that the best possible deal - taking into account our peculiar interests - is pursued during the divorce negotiations.\" \"It is up to our politicians to fight for the best deal for the people of Ireland, north and south,\" says the Irish News. Brexit has involved plenty of discussion around the UK's financial and economic future but, according to the Daily Mirror, one Irish person need not worry about money ever again. \"Irish punter wins £75m\" says its front page, adding that it's not yet known where on the island this extremely jammy\n",

The ex-Chelsea trainee, who has made just 20 Football League appearances, was released by Charlton in May. \"We had a number of good options but Neil stood out,\" said boss Dean Smith. \"He ticks all the boxes in age, room for development and experience at this level and above,\" said Smith. He's an extremely driven young man who wants to be successful. These are the characteristics we're looking for. \"Neil will compete with Craig MacGillivray for a first-team place. They will both push each other on, exactly the kind of competition that we want.\" Etheridge, who began his professional career at Fulham, added: \"The faith that the gaffer and Neil Cutler (Walsall goalkeeping coach) have shown in me means a lot. Now is the time to get my head down and work hard. \"I have gained plenty of international experience in front of big crowds, but I've not played as many league games as I'd have liked.

            "Input: summarize: Two generals said the jihadist group had suffered the losses as troops and allied fighters, backed by US-led air strikes, advanced on several axes. Up to 5,000 IS fighters were believed to be in Mosul ahead of the assault. Despite the territorial gains, commanders have warned that securing Mosul could take weeks, if not months. About 50,000 Iraqi security forces personnel, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen are involved in the operation. More than 100 US military personnel are embedded with them, advising commanders and helping direct coalition air strikes. Other US troops are providing fire support from nearby bases. Lt Gen Stephen Townsend, the commander of US forces in Iraq, said on Wednesday that the coalition forces had delivered more than 2,100 aerial bombs, artillery and mortar shells, rockets and missiles since 17 October. \"This relentless campaign of strikes has removed hundreds of fighters, weapons, and key leaders from the battlefield in front of the Iraqi advance,\" he added. On Thursday, the head of the US military's Central Command, Gen Joseph Votel, told the AFP news agency: \"Just in the operations over the last week and a half associated with Mosul, we estimate they've probably killed about 800-900 Islamic State fighters.\" The Iraqi government informed US commanders on Wednesday that 57 Iraqi soldiers had been killed and about 250 wounded. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are thought to have suffered about 20 to 30 fatalities. Despite the removal of hundreds militants from the battlefield, Gen Townsend warned that IS defences were likely to grow stronger the closer they got to Mosul. The group had \"used an extraordinary amount of indirect fire - mortars, artillery and rockets - and an exceptional number of VBIEDs (Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices),\" he told reporters during a visit to the Qayyarah airbase. Fierce resistance by jihadists has held up soldiers in the Shura area, 40km (25 miles) south of Mosul, prompting elite Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) forces to pause their advance near the village of Bazwaya, only\n",
