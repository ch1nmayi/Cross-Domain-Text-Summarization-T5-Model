# Cross-Domain-Text-Summarization-T5-Model
This project focuses on building a cross-domain text summarization system using the T5-small model. By fine-tuning it on the XSum dataset, which includes over 200,000 news articles, the model learns to generate concise summaries across various domains like news, research, and reviews.
