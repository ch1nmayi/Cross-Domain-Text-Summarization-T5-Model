# Cross-Domain-Text-Summarization-T5-Model
This project develops a cross-domain text summarization system using the T5-small model, a transformer-based architecture. It addresses the challenge of generating concise summaries while retaining essential information across various domains such as news, research, and reviews.

By fine-tuning the T5-small model on the XSum dataset—comprising over 200,000 news articles with abstractive summaries—this project enhances the model's ability to generalize across different content types. The process includes preprocessing input documents, applying a token length constraint, and using a prefix to guide the summarization task.

Leveraging the Hugging Face Seq2SeqTrainer framework, fine-tuning is conducted with a learning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 8, incorporating mixed precision training for efficiency. The model's performance is evaluated using the ROUGE metric, demonstrating promising results in generating coherent and concise summaries.
